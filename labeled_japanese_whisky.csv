1,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Overpriced dissapointment,dull taste  high price  no finish  over-hyped and disappointing ,1
2,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Delicious,"delicious   sugared red fruits and sweet with a morish, cinnamon, aromatic depth ",2
3,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Good for beginners. i know cos i am a beginner,"i am not a whisky expert but i really love the taste  the experience i had i would describe as very comfortable like being snug under a blanket on a cold rainy day  i sip this with my friend through the night and just enjoyed the flavors  that being said, it is more expensive and i feel that for that price, you could get a better whisky  i am not saying this because of the no age but rather, i think you can get more from other scotch for that price  but if you have it in your vault already, its really enjoyable ",2
4,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Yamazaki Tutorial,"this is a terrible yamazaki   very young, unsherried, no finish   the yamazaki 12 is slightly better   the new hibiki nas  harmony  is still better and a better value than the yamazaki 12   the limited edition yamazakis brought out each year are good value and an excellent every day dram  the yamazaki 18 is a very good sherry bomb, unfortunately insanely over-priced   yamazaki sherry cask is one of great bottles, difficult to obtain   the yamazaki 25 is in a world of it s own and bears no relation to any of the others   it is one of the greatest whisky expressions ever created ",1
5,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Very Nice,first time and i like it - fresh but not thin and a sweet depth to it  i know i like a whisky when i can t stop smelling the empty glass  ,2
6,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Unworthy of al the hype over Yamazaki,i canâ€™t believe all these commenters who are fawning over this particular reserve  are they for real? this whisky is nonsensical for its price and unworthy of all the hype that yamazaki or singke malts have been getting  itâ€™s so coarse itâ€™s doesnâ€™t seem very far removed from lab-grade alcohol  the distiller should never have released this (or do they take their customers for fools?)  disappointment ,1
7,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Japanese Yamasaki better than one made somewhere .,my friend brought bottle of this from japan in 2014-2015 and wes so good  and i havenâ€™t  tried anything better since ,2
8,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Delicious. ,nice  i like some vanilla and this has the goods  ,2
9,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Yamazaki Distiller s Reserve,"stands against glenfiddich 12 in it s similarities  i think this is nicer, but i m not sure if that s worth the price difference ",2
11,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,"Not the Best, but No means the Worst","as as good as the hype would have you believe  it s still a very good whisky and something i would buy again  but i did not get much of the fruity tastes i expected  you can taste a faint trace of coconut, but only if you look real hard for it  ",2
12,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Amazing!,"if this is  far cry of yamazaki 12  as some describe it, then yamazaki 12 well better be the nectar of gods  this one is amazing  if you try it in proper tasting glass, it s worth its price for the nose alone  brilliant balance of fruit, nuts and oak (fruits are more apparent)  palate is sweet, a bit spicy with a little burn, but nothing to spoil the pleasure  finish is long and smooth, with pleasant spice at the end  truly delicious and definitely on the list of my favourites now  ",2
14,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,disappointing ,"rather disappointing  can t really taste what i should, it is rather flat with alcohol and oak, doesn t really improve with water, with (melting) ice dilutes too much  it just zastes like a cheap whisky  suntory is generally overpriced, this one especially  a 12yo glenfiddich for 30â‚¬ is better, and this is not a compliment  think, i will buy soda and try highballing it, which normally not my way of drinking whisky ",1
15,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Overrated Yamasaki ,"strong alcohol smell, by added water & lift out the alcohol a very young whiskey   sweet pear flavor, fresh not too long lasting end note  ",1
16,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Good Job!,"is the only version of yamazaki that i have tried, and one of the best single malts i ever tasted, behind from the discontinued miyagikyo 10, and with a place among the places where are glengoyne, arran, glendronach, etc  this yamazaki has a good malt taste, complemented with several flavors that i m not able to distinguish but is delicious and with a medium finish and a bit of effervescence that i love  good job yamazaki ",2
17,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - NAS,"no  aged 12 years  on the box, so this is the replacement nas there are some tasting notes on the box and kinda get a bit of that, however i also have a small amount of the 12yo from a few years ago, and there is much difference in nose and taste  the age statement bottle has some very heady notes as if there where sherry barrels in the mix  those notes are missing from the nas  so i agree with the other comments - it is not comparable to the 12 yo  ",1
18,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,No year mentioned ,just got one and have to say very nice ,2
19,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Quality!,"i have never tried the yamazaki 12, but if people say its better than this one then   holy cow    the 12 must be amazing, because i really think this is a quality quality whisky love the sweet nose and very fruity palate   absolutely lovely palate actually    finish is decent, wait   what am i saying, the finish is excellent and very spicy   very nice ",2
20,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Yamazaki,one of the best ,2
21,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Like a Yamazaki 12 but really rough around the edges.,"i was excited to try this as i found a healthy supply at my local  it s nowhere near as smooth and balanced as the 12  not bad for the money, but for a little bit more, the yamazaki 12 is certainly worth the extra money ",2
22,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Rajiv jaggi,an amazing whiskey with better essence and smoothnes to the skylimits,2
23,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Just delicious,very subtle beautiful flavors and the cedar/sandalwood note really flips my switch ,2
24,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,WOW!,"nose: violet, cookie dough, fruit, malt and saltypalate: licorice, violet candy, spicy, a little seasalti m in love   forgot to add that i ve tasted this in february, the falvour may have changed?",2
26,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Garbage,"yamazaki makes great whisky, this is not one  haven t tried it in a high ball yet but i feel it may be what i resort too  a far cry from the 12 and 18 year",1
27,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Can we stop kidding ourselves?,"look, yamazaki makes some amazing whiskey  this is not one of them ",1
28,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Barely drinkable ,"have tried nas from yoichi, taketsuru, miyagikyo and this one  i like this one the least  def for highball",1
29,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Great,great whiskey ,2
30,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Okay,"to me, a 9-10 rating would categorize a whiskey as  classic  and 7-8 as  excellent    while this is a great whiskey, i can not and will not classify this as classic   i will say that the description is relatively accurate in terms of flavor profile, but could be a bit misleading   this is a very smooth drink and the layers of flavor are very subtle  the oak dominates the palate and i would describe the berry component as gentle not  lively    ",2
31,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Ms kartini tjandra,ok,2
32,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Lovely,great whisky - nice sherry and complexity,2

34,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Great,very good and high quality whisky,2
35,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Pull your head out of your Hind Quarters,it s good for the price but it s only relative in taste   there is more psychology behind the nose and palate   everyone is hopping on the bandwagon putting his/her nose further up the rear of the person who commented before them   it s a good solid dram but nothing near amazing    the yama 12 is far more complex to me but a good friend of mine from japan just chuckles when i talk about it   she says there is stuff out there that even jim murray himself can t grasp   heavy      ,2
36,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Bought a bottle of this candy,so fucking good  ,2

38,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Yummie,"french, japanese and spanish oak makes a subtle, fruity and quite a complex dram",2
39,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,A Very Nice Whisky,"when we have such great whiskys here from scotland or ireland, i don t tend to drink whiskys from abroad  this one was recommended by a friend i was actually taken back by how good this whisky is very spicy, refreshing yet smooth whisky that leaves a sweet trace of fruit on the palate coupled with the complexity of spices which leaves a very satisfying taste that lingers a very good whisky  if you don t normally venture for whiskys from around the world, then i would recommend trying this one, it is a very good dram ",2
40,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,An amazing whiskey,i don t know anything  about whiskey  we went to japan in 2014 to visit my wife family  in our flight to come back in usa we went to the duty free and bought this whiskey  few days later we try it and i was like wouaaa this is very good       i didn t that japan was so good in whiskey  the funny thing is that this whiskey was elected whiskey of the yer 2014 ,2
41,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,New to whisky ,i m new to whisky and just discovering what i like  on hearing a look about japanese whisky i had to try one  and i seem to have tried the right one too  great price and what a taste  seem to be the one i m judging all other whisky so by  love the flavour just keeps on giving  although there are a lot more wiskys to try  ,2
42,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Good bang for buck,"the one bad thing about japanese whiskies is they re all becoming cost prohibitive  this is almost as good as the yamazaki 12yo but 3/4 the price the tasting notes listed at the top are pretty accurate (i smelt cherries as well though - yum  )the finish, while clean & crisp like many japanese whiskies, is maybe a bit more  spicy  than what i d like but i assume that s because it s younger whisky good value if you can t afford a hibiki 12/17yo or yamazaki 12yo ",2
43,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Fyi...,this is one of the most commonly used whiskies in japan for highballs  nothing special on its own but nice as a highball on a hot summers day ,2
44,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Delightul,simply an amazing whisky   please add a few drops of water or a small ice cube  it is transformative    wow ,2
45,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,this is the one,"extremely smooth yet deep, rich aromas  very good and the price is right ",2
46,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,phenomenal whisky,"better than i expected it to be  just by hearing what was in this bottle had me excited enough to be underwhelmed but i was still blown away by the complexity in flavor, and amazingly smooth finish  for the price this is a steal",2
47,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,excellent,excellent,2
48,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Stunningly good! ,"thought i d made a huge mistake with first few glasses as this really packs a full punch   however for the first time ever i added a few drops of water and wow   blew my palate with how it opened up a whirl of complex tastes -  this is seriously good malt whisky which has opened my eyes to a whole new world of options, and my glass to those few drops of water i never thought would ever touch the sides of my whisky glasses      ",2
49,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Depressingly good whisky!,"i received a bottle of this from my son for christmas giving me, a jock, a japanese whisky? obviously taking the piss    that evening, after enjoying a glenfiddich and glenmorangie i said  lets try your yamazaki  or words to that effect well, there s no point denying it, this is a seriously good whisky the richness and complexity blows my staple diet to smithereens  now i m no expert, but i did not detected a hint of  strawberries ,  rasperries  and definately not  coconut  though there is a smooth sweetness there, and this is certainly a bloody good whisky thankfully the balance of the universe was restored when i opened my single cask, first oak filled, 30 year old macallan  wow   another world  ",2
50,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Marvellous stuff,i m a big fan of japanese whisky  i first tried this at the yamazaki distillery just outside kyoto  it would seem it is replacing the 10 and 12 year olds which is fine by me  it s better than both of them  my only problem is that it costs nearly twice as much here as it does in japan  ,2
51,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,A MUST HAVE,"this is a must have    for 70 us, it s worth every penny    thank god i got this before they sold out, just wish i bought more  this actually compares to some of the 150 plus dollar a bottle malts i ve had over the years  each glass seems to have varied notes and seem to get better with each glass ",2
52,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Exquisite,"wanted to try the yamazaki 12  asked a friend to get this from singapore (since it s not easily available in dubai) and what he got me was the distiller s reserve  having tried the 12 before, this one came across as a very pleasant surprise  it is rich and textured, quite deep as a single malt and its fruitiness and redolence of varied casks comes across post a couple of tastings  which makes it quite layered  especially loved the finish of this, which is exquisite in its mouthfeel  small tip: it actually tastes better with a single small ice cube and around 4-5 small splashes of cold water  enjoy this if you love a deep, rich whiskey  slainthe, shantesh",2
53,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,spot on,"beautiful, seriously good dropthat nose is inticing with each swallow,follows a smile hardest part is saying goodnight to it great value, steve mcgiff st  ives cornwall",2
54,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Growing on me steadily,a gift from a friend & my first japanese whisky and my first impression was nice and smooth but something missing at the heart of it  repeated tastings however have me more and more intrigued  i like a dram that keeps up the surprises  incredibly well balanced and one of the smoothest malts i ve had ,2
55,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Lovely,put a bottle of this out at my wedding after picking it up at sainsburys for around â£40  it was one i the most popular whiskys by far with loads of people asking me the next day to remind them what it was nice fruity flavours with a good finish  i ve gone and bought myself a bottle as there was none left after the wedding  ,2
56,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Delicious,"picked this up in sainsbury s of all places for â£42 (not even on offer)  it really is tasty and great value for the money  my first experience of japanese whisky, and at this rate definitely not my last  as it happened they also had the hakashu distiller s reserve so might have to give that a go as well as i am a fan of a bit of smoke  ",2
57,The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Yamazaki,Showing off. . . ,"i had a glass of this over the weekend  the best whisky in its price bracket, it s soft on the palette, complex, silky  those who love the hibiki range should jump on this       ",2
58,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,The Great Japanese Whisky,i love scotch whisky but after have these japanese whisky (yamazaki 12 / hibiki 12 / hibiki 17) the taste so complexity than the scotch  i m wondering why they re all sold out  quickly  in australia,2
59,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Great Japanese Whisky,i love scotch whisky but they re not complexity like japanese whisky ( yamazaki 12 / hibiki 12 etc    ) now i m wondering why all these japanese whisky sold out quickly the whole worldwide,2
60,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,A good one.,"a realy good experience  sold out in norway, had to go to sweden to get it worth the trip ",2
61,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Good, not great, for price","good, but not any better than the rest of the pack in the price range  there are in every good liquor store several scotches in the same price range, at least a couple of which will be better than the yamazaki  that said, it is a good whisky, enjoyable to the nose and the palate  it lacks just a bit of fullness, however, necessary to move toward the front of the class ",2
62,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Excellent,excellent enjoyed it a lot  but it has become too expensive ,2
63,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Decent, but not for its price range ","simply doesnâ€™t have the depth and range of flavor as most japanese whiskies in the 75-125 price range  if youâ€™re looking to try something new and have had all the others, itâ€™s probably worth giving it a shot  but if youâ€™re considering other japanese whiskeys around 100, almost anything on that list would likely be more dynamic  ",1

68,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Superb!,"awesome   i wish it cost as much as it used to ($60-$70 usd circa 2015)  the media and hype (maybe justified?) has brought the price much higher these days  very similar taste to the 18, although a bit more rough but not by much  wondering if it was worth it to purchase the yamazaki 18    very balanced and rich  full body, rich flavors, hint of vanilla, floral, nuts, and a tinge of spice  i wish it was kept a secret before the ratings   ",2

75,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,overrated,japanese whiskies are overrated ,1
76,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,OK at best,"in my opinion, this is overpriced and overrated  i found it very nutty, oily and oaky  i did not find tropical fruits  i found oranges but the nutty and oakiness just overpower it  ",1
77,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Delicious but price has sky rocketed ,"first, let me say that when handed this i was shocked as to how good it was   it was full bodied and flavored and tasted deeper than the average many 15 year olds   but the pricing model has made it not-affordable   just a few years ago this could be found in ny for $40 and in ca for $30   even in 2016, around $60 in ny - suddenly, the price has shot up and is selling at crazy numbers   i can t imagine that the average scotch drinkers can afford this anymore and they won t be losing market share   which is too bad   ",2
78,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,A Must to have ,"i had it a taste of it recently during a stay in hiroshima , brilliant malt , i liked it s sweet palate ,soft fruits and the smoky taste   the price was good too at about 5â‚¬ a generous  one  ",2

Far too expensive.","had a bottle of this a few years ago at a much more reasonable price and thought it was good now, i ve been lucky enough to have been given another and thought i d review it   if it cost the same as some standard issue scottish 10-14 year old whiskies then i would say it s decent offering but for me it s no way near as good as the much more subtle yet elegantly satisfying hakushu distiller s reserve  good appealing nose, nice unimposing, sightly sweet flavour but slightly too much burn and nothing particularly interesting coming through to me, it s overpriced fairly decent generic whisky ",1

89,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,One of the best,"visited the yamazaki distillery, tried a number of offerings including 35 year and the amazing sherry cask  the 12 year is not quite the complete package that the 18 year is, but the best single malt i can afford  btw at the time of writing you could no longer get the 12 year, even at the distillery, but i tracked down a few bottles at a larger outlet in kyoto at a price i was ok with, brought them home along with a couple of the hakushu 12 year, that some of my fellow tasters at the distillery felt was superior  will do a bit of sampling once i m over the jet lag ",2

91,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Dry and smoky,"i ve had a chance to try a number of suntory whiskies, yamazaki 18 and 12 years old being among them, and, reluctantly, i have to say most of their expressions feature a slightly smoky palate with an incredibly oaky and dry finish  i had been expecting a more profound experience, but having tasted the 12 year old yamazaki, i m not sure it is capable of giving decent, oaky scottish malts a run for their money  the price tag certainly makes me lean more towards bottlings such as the 12 yo edradour or the 12 yo cardhu ",1

100,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,The Seeker reviews Yamazaki 12 Year Old. ,an absolutely mouth watering nose of creamy nuttiness and fruit medley  this carries on wonderfully onto the palate with a clear bourbon influence which is also obvious on the nose  a lingering fruit and oaky finish wraps things up perfectly  there s no smoke or peat just fruit and spice akin to the aforementioned bourbons it so closely resembles  this is a textbook japanese single malt  the only downside is the price which is way too steep at present  luckily i had mine for just â£35 from a good friend which is an absolute steal  ,2
101,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Very good,"first off i ll say that i found this much cheaper than others on here so i went in to to it a lot more open minded and with lower expectations  this whisky is fantastic  the nose is very sweet, with strong vanilla coming through  it is a very light whisky, and really shines neat  the finish is strongly reminiscent of bourbon, reminding me of blantons more than anything else  overall if you can find this for a good price, it is definitely worth adding to your collection  ",2

109,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,mr s hopkins,a whiskey to savour a very good flavour profile,2
110,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Overrated and overpriced.,"acquired this after all hoopla exploded about suntory s yamazaki (mainly due to the sherry cask version)  i generally drink single-malt scotch and straight bourbon and, mainly because i am research before you buy person, i have generally had a wonderful journey through the world of whisky  i can honestly say, this was the first time i have felt let-down by a single malt  it s not that it s bad, it has an interesting and quite unique nose (which i think the mom tasting notes are pretty on point about, though banana is the tropical fruit i think they are talking about) and the body is pretty full and substantial  that said, it isn t all that engaging and it feels muddled, with that banana stomping all over the short hints of sherry and citrus in the palate  that said, if you find the flavor profile interesting (and a lot of people do), then it would be easy to recommend at 40-50 dollars which brings us to price: even if i loved the profile, the execution is too muddled and fuzzy (almost blended-malt like) to be even remotely worth 80-100 dollars they are now charging for the 12  at 40 bucks it d be reasonable, at 80+ it s just plain overpriced ",1
111,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Delicious ,me and my boyfriend have been looking all over for this stuff  he loves this    finally found a vendor i m miami   so i m driving down there from coconut creek tomorrow to get it  i will get him some for christmas ,2

114,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Very nice but......,"tried a bottle i recently bought from m,chester airport , i found it quite smooth and it seemed taste differently on each  taste  but i was disappointed when it had gone although i would be happy to buy @ 40-50 quid anything more  i think i would prefer a lagavullin 16 which  i thought was a touch smoother  ",2
115,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Totally overrated,"i have tried a lot of japanese whiskies and this one is totally overrated i have to say  it is unfocused, to much taste of alcohol and you get the impression it is not 12 years old at all  there are some nice fruity and spicy notes but nothing comes together the way it should be in a 12 yo  if you wish to explore japanese whisky go with nikka taketsuru 17 or hibiki 17  they are very different from this one but much better and much more well rounded  no point in spending so much money when you can get a good glenmorangie for half or 2/3s of the price  the 18yo is very interesting on the other hand, a bit pricy though ",1
116,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Intensifed ,"looks like scotch whisky, smells like it, tastes like it, but   all characteristics have been elevated a notch   i found it to be more intense in every category   i really like it ",2

118,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Unique and unlike American scotch or Irish ,im a single malt scotch junkie through and through   this whiskey is in a different category   and i dig it   the color is nice med light amber and it leaves oily trails on the glass if you swirl it   the nose is citrus through and through with notes of a sweeter fruit   you d almost expect it to be a sugary drink from the nose   the mouthfeel is surprisingly dry which i like   the finish is citrus   and tart and bitter and i mean that as a compliment   the flavor is subtle enough that if you enjoy it with different foods you might pick up different notes and flavors that you didn t notice before   my final verdict though is biased   as a stand alone whiskey i still prefer the unique taste of a peated scotch   but i ve had peated scotch i like less than this excellent whiskey   cheers,2

123,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Not bad,"tried this one a couple of years ago and just didn t  get it    nice whisky for sure, but tasted like a fairly standard/light highland malt   nothing for peat-heads obviously, but very understated generally   a good honest malt but not in a hurry to buy one even when it cost â£35 ",2

137,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Suntory Unequaled,"living in tokyo, i became a fan of suntory scotch for its smoothness and non-biting flavor  yamazaki was not marketed then and i can only go by my favorite suntory reserve which was considered the distillery s premier brand  i did not realize suntory whiskeys were available in the u s  and bought an equally good substitute that comes closest to it : chivas regal  since suntory acquired jim beam, they are readily available and i bought a bottle last week   an amazing whiskey  ",2
138,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Whisky with class and Taste,i tried the yamazaki 12 year old yesterday  the blend is so wonderful and the taste savours in your mouth all the while very light and simply beautiful for an enjoiable evening  great invention   ,2
139,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Crazy mature,"totally agree with the reviewer saying it could pass for an 18   i m *currently* sipping it right next to an aberlour 18 at double the price and it s almost identical (*slightly* more light-white-fruit and less heavy-red-fruit than the aberlour in flavor profile, but only slightly; maturity feels identical)   i ve got a balvenie 12 nearby and it s significantly more rough and less flavorful, yet more expensive than the yamazaki ",2

147,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Flavorful,"there s absolutely nothing bad i can say about this one except it s maybe *too* flavorful   but even that   just marginally so   it *slightly* tastes more aperitif than a whisky should imo, but maybe that s the future   the chocolate vaguely reminds me of the bushmills 21 i once had, but more subtle   me, i ll still take something a bit more malty like a glen grant or old pulteney   but this is still very good and worth a try ",2
148,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Fantastic,"loved it  simple as that  only one small negative, a bottle of malt is enjoyed before it is opened, so please don t put a cheap arse plastic top on it   this bottle is way too good and should have a cork to get that pop from opening ",2

153,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Needs a bit of time,"i bought this bottle a long time ago for a party, freshly opened i found this to taste very odd, it had a strong sweetness and taste of caramel and about an equally strong bitter tannin taste and this yielded some sort of flat taste curve of sorts  it didn t linger and you was left with just this dry tannin taste now, however, it has been in the shelf for a few months at about 70% of content left and i tried this again last night and i must say i was very positively surprised, it have developed a very nice round sweet taste with some sort of vanilla mixed with some fruity jelly candy tastes and the nose felt very developed with first having very much orange peel -citrus smell where after the same jelly candy smell came about after a while definitely one of my favorites now  ",2
154,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Rating for above,solid drop ,2
155,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Bit different but rather good.,"nice change flora through the nose with some more exotic tones  tastes rather good warmth again flora notes some honey sweetness and citrus,maybe nicer for the money but nice stuff and worth a try personally prefer the redbreast  to green spot and glenfarclaas to dalmorre but great thing whiskey something for everyone   ",2

160,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,eye opener,"this was the first whisky that opened my eyes to the wonderful world of single malts  before this, i was in the obscure world of blends and the occasional glenlivet and glenfiddich 12  i ve never looked back ever since  i ve had the likes of many single malts throughout the years and the yamazaki 12 is still on my top 3 favorites in the 12 year range   ",2
161,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,WM WHALIN,real good nick flavor and notes  looking forward to what you do next  thanks you,2
162,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,"ok, but not great","smooth it s ok, yamazaki 10 is much better and the 18 is the best i ve ever had, would not buy a bottle of 12 again",1
163,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,It sweetness whisky ,is it very nice whisky in around single malt   it testy very good bit a sweetness  you can find out in kualulampor  daikanyama,2
164,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Alcoholic,i purchase one just for tge fun of it because its japanese  but with all honesty this is one of those whisky thats hard not to recomend who likes a fine drink  i mean very very fine whisky  you can call me biased but the yamazaki is one of the best whisky i ever tasted ,2
167,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,One of the best,i was given a bottle of this for my birthday last week and i must say it it probably amongst the best malts i have ever had the pleasure to enjoy get over your parochial prejudice and give it a try       you won t be disappointed ,2
168,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Excellent but a bit sweet,"smooth is the word  and adding water,  is a must to bring out the smells and taste  i recommend about 30-40% which is a tad more than for most the only objection is that it is a whisky intended for the broad audience and so the experience is a bit, well average  then again my taste is for the somewhat more smokey and with a tad more oomph  it is a bit on the sweet side in my view  then again you cannot go wrong serving yamazaki to your guests after your finer dinner though ",2
169,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Loved it,"i picked up a bottle of this because it looked different   couldn t have been happier i did    i will say (from my experience), adding a drop of water really adds to this   it settles it down and allows the smells and taste to develop   try it and let me know  ",2
170,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Really good,smooth dram and very interesting experience from japan arigato gozaimashita  ,2
171,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Mixed feelings,"i had a lot of expectations from this whisky, my gf got me a bottle for christmas,it turned out i was mostly disappointed  the nose is really great,and there are some interesting notes but i found the palate very unrefined and with poor balance  a rough aftertaste that i did not appreciate at all  did not taste smooth at all imo  anyway i ll try to give another shot at yamazaki with the 18 yo ",1
172,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Rather good,"lovely smooth 12 yr old  excellent finish, but have i gone mad  dentist like numbness to follow  ",2
173,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Rubbish,"i found this is taste rather unrefined and very disappointing if you love a good single malt, this certainly isn t one go for aberfeldy 12 which is both cheaper and better than this one ",1
174,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Excellent or  Subarashi  as the Japanese might say.,"the french and italians didn t invent wine but became very famous for it, i suspect the same is happening with japanese whisky the yamazaki 12yo is very smooth and robust with spicy dried fruit and creme brulee on the palate nikka whisky s yoichi and hibiki 12yo are very nice if you can find them ",2
176,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Golden Saki - smooth ,"this japanese whisky is so smooth, with a hint of golden sweetness   very nice   ",2
177,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,hits the spot,"what a wonderfull whisky  great on the nose and pallett, very moorish  cant rate this fine drop enough  so put your hand in your pocket and get some, you wont be disapointed ",2
178,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,beauitful,tried this whisky at a wedding i attended without ever hearing of it   and i must so i love it   will be purchasing a bottle after pay day   worth â£4 50 a shot that im paying currently,2
179,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,a fine dram,can t go wrong with this one - will be trying the other japanese brands soon,2
180,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Chisou s only choice of house whiskey,tried this at chisou (japanese restaurant in london) - it is the only whiskey they stock and for good reason  it is incredibly smooth and delicious   ,2
181,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,my review above,i forgot to add the pretty little stars   have 5 its lovely  ,2
182,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,It tastes different now than last time,it tastes much differnt than with ice from the spar than from ice from my mums house   other than that its a lovely rich flavour  ,2
183,Yamazaki 12 Year Old,Yamazaki,Love this whiskey.,"phenomenal    a great whiskey for the price   i like it as much as the yamazaki 18, but it is quite a bit cheaper   buy a bottle and you will know why the japanese whiskeys are doing so well at international awards   just so i don t sound biased towards japanese whiskeys, i am drinking a dram of highland park 18 right now and enjoying it thoroughly ",2
184,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Bit disappointing for the price,good not great,1
185,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"One of the best, but best brace for the hit to your wallet","this is one of the finest whiskys i ve tasted, i generally keep several bottles of the 12 on hand but reserve the 18 for special occasions only  mouthfeel is a rich and oily  the nose has hints of char, oak, fruit, caramel, vanilla and a spicy character one can likely attribute to the mizunara oak casks used during maturation  the palate continues in this fashion, but a nutty/malty character also emerges  the finish is sweet, with a notable fruity sherry influence, more malt, nuts, and hit of spicy oak  this is a rich whisky that can rightly be described as  luxurious   i ve tried a number of single malts including many similarly aged scotch single malts, and this ranks with the best  my only caveat would be the inflated price tag, which unfortunately seems to impact any age-statement japanese whisky these days  that said, it s a cracking good dram and well worth trying if you run into it on the whiskey menu of an upscale bar ",2
186,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Wish it was easier to find,"lucked out and got it from master of malt, but so hard to find  one of the best japanese whiskyâ€™s you can get your hands on if youâ€™re lucky ",2
187,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,My favorite Japanese whisky,big step up from the 12  one of my favorites  ,2
188,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Save your money,"unimpressive, hot on the nose, and certainly not worth the price of admission  i have enjoyed a number of single malts with far more depth and character at a fraction of the cost  moving on   ",1
189,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Pieace of Art,"a little bit better than 12, basic flavors are same but more round deep  a little bit smoother u will feel it  but i did not like only bitterness at the end it still in my mouth after 15 minutes, some may like small bitterness like from ipa beer  if i choose btw 12 and 18 its 18 definitely, its piece of art  ",2

196,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Second Best Whisky I ve EVER Tasted,without a doubt the pinnacle of japanese whisky  not the merest hint of sulphur present and a nose and taste that takes me back to the finest of scotch i tasted in the 80 s and 90 s  second only to the macallan 30 year old sherry oak for whisky heaven ,2
197,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Very tasty,i remember when a bottle cost 100$ a few years ago before the mass started enjoying it   now its too expensive  aint worth it ,2
198,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Back from the Distillery,"i ve had yamazaki 12 for years now  my wife and i just wrapped a 2 week vacation in japan  while there i was lucky enough to stop in at the suntory yamazaki distillery  they let you sample hibiki 21, hakushu 18 and yamazaki 18  being on a budget i could only purchase one and i was going for the hibiki 21  by far the best whiskey i have ever tasted  unfortunately they were sold out  i hate to say that the yamazaki 18 came in second but it s a good second  it has amazing flavors and is extremely smooth  the 700 ml bottle cost me 27,000 yen or around $240 us  since i won t be going back to japan any time soon this will only come out on special occasions ",2

218,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Had to grow on me, but wow...","the first time i tried this i really couldn t see what the fuss was about  too complex, way too much going on  a few days later i went back and tried it again, and then again   and a splash of water really helped  nose - japanese plum, apricot and bananapalate - like a cricket bat of oak right between the eyes and then a rush of fruitfinish - very long, more plum and apricot  really very very good   ",
219,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Masoon,delicious whiskey   couldn t recommend it enough ,

222,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,The Real Deal ,spend the 50 bucks for a dram    don t look back  ,
223,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,if you can find one,you should get it   won t regret it  ,
224,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,The truth,or not? it s overpriced for what it is    ,
225,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,You think so?,"i would love to agree with the comments here but on the 18 year i just cannot  i had a double shot in an underground retro bar on the midosuji side of osaka station with perfect female company and ( maybe i stuck my nose in too far) was assaulted by the alcohol, making me regret my double for the price of a single purchase  the 18 year old grew on me but guess what?for half the price and a sublime experience get hold of the nikka 21 year old-it is a gem  i m not  anti suntory- far from it, the 25 year old yamazaki is in my whisky dreams but the 18 year old    sorry, it doesn t move me enough ",
226,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Love, don t like","i wrote the conversely-titled review earlier   i ve changed my tune   my tasting notes are still essentially the same, but i ve grown to appreciate them more   just because it s so distinct i d think almost anyone would have go through this in stages like i did   at first it s just, eh, interesting, but is it *really* what i want?  (and for *that* kind of money?)  however after working my way through the whiskey world, there s just something about this that keeps drawing me back   it s like nothing else that i ve ever tasted   each nose, each sip, each swallow, is its own experience note the 12 is still excellent too, but in a completely different way ",
227,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Amazing taste ,this whiskey is the best 18yr  ive tasted  but for the price old pulteney 21 is better because it cost less with a better finish,
228,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Overrated,you can do better for less money,
229,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Zoom On A Yamaza,"rev up your engine and enjoy to the fullest for this bottle will take your taste-buds on a ride that you don t want to stop  really makes me enjoy japanese whisky and how intrinsic they are to the whisky community  malty, sultana, white grapes, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, brown sugar with a sherry oak flavor  goes down smooth, no smoke and full of body  a+  look forward to buying another bottle  ",
230,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Like, don t love","was really excited to get this as an xmas gift  love the yamazaki 12, and given all the reviews/awards on this one i thought it must be  the one   especially given how hard it is to find in the us, this was the best present i could have asked for it s hard to say that this isn t good or even that it isn t phenomenal  it s perfect if it s what you want  it s old though  some old book, old pipe resin there  just enough, and perfectly done, to be a perfect malt if you like that kind of feel  not so much that it overwhelms the other rich influences (like bushmills does); just enough to say i m *aged* and if you don t like it then that s *your* problem so, that s that  for my money, i like a mac 18 with its sherry feel or even a auchentoshan 21 with its terrific vanilla smoothness but slight punch, a little more  still, tasting side-by-side with the 12, i can get that they re related but this is way better; and i like the 12 a lot   so i ll probably keep one of these around, if i can keep finding it; maybe it s one of those things that needs to grow on you   (my first taste was 3 weeks ago) ",
231,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Best Whiskey. Period.,"i have had the opportunity to try many whiskeys across the world, including johnny walkers of all colors (including blue), but yamasaki 18 is the smoothest, most perfectly balanced whiskey i have ever come across  some people prefer more peaty finishes, more spice, more   something, but the yamasaki is a literal distillation of japanese kaizen (refinement until perfection)  buy a bottle and keep it on the shelf to celebrate sublime moments in life  i just bought a new bottle to celebrate the birth of my son, and look forward to opening it in another 18 years ",
232,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Awesome but think twice at $230,"this is a great whisky and maybe i m being to harsh saying that $230 is too much   the way its made, the sherry casks, with slight pete smoke, and the clean pure flavor that it produces are a+   that being said, i d rather own a macallan ruby or a macallan 18 for the price   if you re anything like i am and read these reviews, i ll tell you that i will always buy another mac 12,18 ruby, or mac 25   i can t really live without them   i find myself reaching for this range of scotches 9 times out of 10 over the yamazaki   all that said, this is a great dram, and i ll guarantee you ll like it   i ll even rate it 5 stars   however with all that said, if i were running from a burning building and i could only take one bottle of whisky in my collection, i d leave this one behind and grab the mac 18 instead ",
233,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Amazing!!!,"if anyone have only been drinking single malt whisky from scotland, give this a try soon  chances are that you will be stuck and love this for a long time the way this whisky was made is so clean and can be drunk so effortless with a sweet scent that captivates you to just want to on drink it  the next time you would have realized that the whole bottle is finished  yes, it is that smooth and i will leave the tasting notes to each individual to experience it  ",
234,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Lovely Whisky, great service by Master of Malt","first time buying whisky online, and very happy with the fast service at good value from this website yamazaki 18 is a super single malt  a favourite ",
235,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Big whisky, but big bucks (Fat Pig Whisky Club)","on the nose this has lots of burnt lemon like its been charred on a bbq with some sweet sherry raisin and a touch of pepper on the palette is more burnt citrus fruit, but more like orange this time with some complex molasses and spice flavours on the finish  some aniseed, cinnamon and nutmeg lingers on the finish an absolute belter of a whisky  worth the punt if you can split the cost and share a bottle between some good friends ",
236,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Best of the Bunch,"i recently tried eight japanese whiskeys (for the first time) and narrowed it down to this one and the 21-year blended hibiki  same price, but i went with the yamazaki will get the hibiki next time  both are among the best whiskeys i ve ever tried  and this is coming from a bourbon drinker ",
237,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Speechless,"recently came back trip from japan  tried the yamazaki 12yo, 18yo and 25 yo at the suntory factory just outside of osaka  very distinct flavour and differences  12yo is nice, but for the best value, smoothness and taste, 18yo on the rocks is my pick  compared 18y yamazaki to 18yo mccallum, yamazaki 18y because of the smoothness and pleasant taste 25yo for those with an acquired taste after a more intense oak/smoke favour my only regret is not bringing a few bottles back from japan  australia doesn t sell/have 18yo yamazaki readily available here  hope this helps  ",
238,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Amazing,"this is the first japanese single malt i experienced, and it is quite smooth and pleasant in taste ",
239,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Looking forward to it!,"just returned from a motorcycle trip around japan (honshu, kyushu and shokuku)   we needed to burn some spare yen at haneda airport, so i bought a bottle of the yamazaki 18 year at duty free   can t wait to try it ",
240,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Seinaru ushi!,"i tried this for the first time over the weekend (1/25) and all i can say is holy cow    i ve heard about the japanese whiskies, but never had a chance to sample one   the flavors of vanilla, smoke, chocolate, sherry, oak and honey   i passed my glass to my friend and she refused to give my glass back   and she doesn t drink whisky    i m buying a bottle as soon as i can get my hands on one ",
241,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Best all around,"absolutely phenom        big oak, nice finish  ",
242,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Classy dram,"color:  dark ambernose: rich in oak   i pick up both the sherry casks and herbal notes from the japanese oak palate:  very rich and complex   notes of chocolate, licorice and fruit finish:  quite long ",
243,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Best I ve tasted (tie),this and the aussie  limeburner  would be the best whiskies i ve tasted ,
244,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,i wish i had the money ,only ever had the chance to have one bottle of this brill dram because of the price  best ive ever had,
245,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Yamazaki 18yo,a taste of heaven  tones of raisins and vanilla  very rich flavour,
246,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"the best yet!, but keeping my mind open","so smooth and complex, brilliant",
247,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Superb Whiskey,"this has to be my favourite  absolutely fun to the nose, and pleasant on the taste as well  would definitely recommend this ",
248,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,What s,goin on,
249,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,A Knockout,"i m new to japanese whiskies but this was fantastic, easily my current favorite  my first bottle is almost done and there are 2 on standby  so good it s the type of dram you want a case of just in case they stop making it  full of flavor, complexity and will probably please most serious scotch drinkers ",
250,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,mmmmmmmmmmm,"i only had a dram of this remarkable whiskey, but simply put it is unique,the nose on this will make you feel very excitedthe japanese have nailed this craftthe obsession with their whiskey has begun",
251,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Great whisky!,"smooth, decadent and intense  with everyting you can hpe for in an 18 yo single malt  this is one of the best whiskies i have tried  ",
252,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,To add to the above review from Same person..,both the yamazaki 18 year old and the bufallo trace they both have notes of rum which is just great,
253,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,OMG!! Yamazaki 18 Year Old Vs Bufallo Trace (old bottle),"im no whisky expert and bought the yamazaki 18 as a punt due to its great reviews and the fact i had never tasted a jp whisky before after tasting it i came to the conclusion that it was a very good whisky first impressions were a rich floral sherry bouquet ,sweet, woody smooth/balanced/very rounded after finishing it though i would probs not buy again due to its high price point well i have just bought a bottle of buffalo trace(old bottling) and after opening the bottle and pouring a glass and noticed instantly that this is similar to the bouquet of the yamazaki 18 with its floral,honey,sherry aroma taste wise its very similar but with more burn and spice which probably is due to its higher abv at 45% and spices added this bourbon is just great and believe me if you liked the yamazaki 18 its a no brainer the yamazaki 18 is smoother and more complex in all areas but for the price the buffalo trace is a clear winner at 55 pounds for 1 75 l ",
254,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,no words,"this is by far the best whisky i have tasted for a long time, i feel bad saying this as i am scottish, but you know what - they have got it right  as soon as you smell this whisky, you say to yourself oh boy this gonna be good going to buy a full bottle next month for sure ",
255,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Lovely, easy drinking","great sherried (but not overly) smooth and easy drinking whisky  getting on the pricey side these days - but price aside,it s delicious  only problem is its moreishness and easy drinking can lead to slightly overdoing it    ",
256,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Not peated,"i disagree with the below comment, the yamazaki 18 year old is not heavily peated  a lovely dram though, with lots going on  ",
257,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,MultiWandering,"the whisky is extremely peated, not my taste, but very smooth, i can see why others like it, it has a very long finish and is otherwise very nice, but very peated ",
258,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Great dram,"much darker and oakier than the 10 and 12 year old yamazakis, but not at all bitter (unlike some other old dark whiskies i ve tried)",
259,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,My New Favorite,"simply put, a fabulous whiskey  well worth the price ",
260,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Fantasticles,"one of my fave whiskeys it is intensely sherry but also incredibly complex and shifting between sips sometimes i can get an incredible aged parchment dry finish, other times it seems like im drinking liquid christmas pudding all in all a positively schizophrenic whiskey but absolutely blinding ",
261,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Interesting,"quite different to the scottish drams i ve been getting used to but doesn t suffer for that  lots of depth to the flavours, they come at you in very distinct waves   very tricky to describe but not encountered anything quite like it in the islay/speyside single malts i ve tried so far and would happily recommend this to anyone",
262,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Great Whiskey,managed to pick up a bottle from birmingham airport duty free for â£32  fantastic find and easily worth double the price incredibly balanced flavour     ,
263,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,My favorite!,"what?    no 5 star reviews?  very much time for one   this is my favorite whiskey   not only a paragon of japanese whiskey, but a paragon of whiskey period   i wish it were cheaper, but such is life   i have tried and enjoy many whiskeys, but this is definitely my number 1 ",
264,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Harry from Sydney,i must say this fantastic whiskey took me by surprise  a must try indeed  ,

266,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,Nicola @ Whiskyboys.com,one of the best examples of japanese whisky i ve ever tasted   definitely worth a purchase or two  nic,
267,Yamazaki 18 Year Old,Yamazaki,JÃ¶gge,awesome  ,
268,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Liquid Gold,"totally fantastic whiskey, favourite ",
269,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Amazing Whiskey,"i ve been to the yamazaki distillery in japan, and have tried all of them except for the 25 year    for every day sipping whiskey, i prefer the 10 to the 12 year   unlike other whiskey s there s a real difference between them  the 10 is a little smoother, while the 12 year is more complex  it s interesting, because the regular single malt bottle has a deep charred taste from the barrel, that mellows out over time   at 10 years, it s mellowed out as much as it s going to  by 12, it s gained complexity    at 18 years, it s like nothing else   it seems to change flavor in your mouth for about a minute   unreal  so, if you can get it the 10 year is a great in-between whiskey  ",
270,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Very, very good.",you simply dont get annything better single malts for this price   ,
271,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Nice Whisky ,this is a very good 10 year old whisky it has a nice round body of flavours and stands up to top brands   ,
272,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,simply great,first try of japanese whisky and it is very promising  18 yo is the next goal  i highly recommend this as alternative to scottish standard,
273,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Nice & smooth..,nice one,
274,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Exquisite,great dram  buy this before it runs out   soon to be discontinued   but the 12 year old is even better though    or the 18  ,
275,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Just bought a bottle First ever bottle of Japanese I ve ever bought, looking forward to it","got a little bit of spice to it, it s smooth too  would i buy another bottle? yes  next purchase yamazaki 18yrs as it s won awards",

278,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Debate,"this is simply put, absolutely beautiful my very first purchase of a japanese whiskeythe flavours arrive in waves, i thoroughly recommend this i have tried the 12 year old, and 18, and boy do they hit the spotthe japanese have nailed the craft of exquisite whiskey sstephen mcgiff, st ives cornwall     ",
279,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Expensive mixer,"can only drink this with a mixer, you re better off with an super market own brand ",
280,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Waste of Money!,why do you stock this stuff? the 12 is just as bad   anything is better than this  ,
281,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Prefer metho,horrible,
282,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Beautiful unique Whisky ,you know nothing of what you speak  it s your taste that is awful  ,
283,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,Awful!,"tried this a while ago - foul just about describes it thankfully the supermarket where purchased, exchanged it for something worthy of the price charged to date, it s the only single malt i ve been so horrified with  others have been at least drinkable, even if they were too peaty or too spirited for my palette ",
284,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,"Not bad, not great","i found the body lacking in depth, but well-rounded and subtle  excellent finish yet short-lived  definitely not a bad choice, but in this price range i d say with this one you re paying a bit extra for the exotic aspect of the deal  ",
285,Yamazaki 10 Year Old,Yamazaki,The best 10YO,"absolute quality   very complex nose, including plummy bananas or banana plums big&round in the palate, with a lingering fruity/automnal finish  i d say this is the best whisky in the 10yo range ",
286,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,My God. ,"there s not much to say  i ve never tasted a whisky like this  to be honest, at first i was skeptical  the nose was familiar, the mouthfeel familiar  the taste familiar  but the finish  oh  my  god  not one single whisky i ve experienced is even remotely close to the complexity and longevity of the finish found in this gem  raisin, chocolate, almond, all working their way from deep at the back of your tongue, and slowly to the front, with a never ending evolution of experience  i count at least 1-2 minutes of altering experiences  i ve sadly never owned a bottle, and only experienced it as a single nip  but that nip was heavenly  ",
287,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Very much like Macallan 18,"i got a 3cl sample of this and just tried it   this is so much like magellan 18 i couldn t believe it    the yamazaki 18 is also sherried, but lighter sherry and slightly sweet compared to the yamazaki sherry cask   the macallan 18, in comparison, has a deeper sherry flavor, likely due to the fact that it is a true speyside character to balance   the sherry cask has a slightly more complex sherry nuance compared to macallan 18, but they are so much alike it may be challenging to decipher the two in a blind taste test i m glad i had a chance to try it, as the novelty of being best whiskey that year in murray s whiskey bible   it is the best example of a sherried whiskey        somewhere between macallan 18 and ardbeg dark cove (a more heavily sherried islay), more closer to the former than the latter ",
288,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Price!,your e out of your mind   ,
289,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Tasty,tasty  ,
290,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Patetic,"this is not whishy  this is a kitsch product for rich idiots  if we got to the point of having to pay 3000 pounds for drink a good whiskey, then it is better not to buy more anything  limited edition   please    is just a commercial swindle  because the suntory don t produce 50000 bottle at a reasonable price instead that only few bottle at shameful price? even if i had all the money of the world, i do not buy it for 3500â‚¬ ",
291,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,It s very rare & priced accordingly ,"was recently very fortunate to try a dram of this and there s no doubt it s a cohesive, well balanced, flavorsome expression, packed with depth and complexity   but    stand it up against a gordon & macphail 25 - 30 year old sherry cask strathisla at less than a sixth of the price and in my humble opinion there can only be one winner, and not only on cost either loving your work m of m guys, keep it up dave",

332,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Conclusion,"there is a reason why this whisky is in high demand, it s not because it s highly rated in some review, it s because if you have tasted this whisky, you will realize that there are absolutely no substitutes  even if there were, none of you will be posting all these negative remarks and showing how ugly you truly are yes, it s uncool for suntory to make small batches every year, but have you thought that maybe that reason is because they are perfectionist? they won t release mediocre whisky into the market just to make money, especially since their cost price to people like mom is as per the norm  all i m saying is, if there s a high demand for a product, be prepared to pay for it, if you can t afford it, go drink something else  if there s a substitute for it, go buy that instead and stop complaining that this is just another overrated whisky  i ve tried it and it s the best whisky i ve ever tasted  even if you think i m wrong, taste is all personal, not general   thank you mom for giving us a chance to own this bottle at a fair price  ",

370,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,@ @ Japanese Whisky ,the issue is not charity and donating in general the issue is (a) by saying proceeds (above rrp) go to charity it automatically implies there s gonna be a bidding war  the price will go way up there where ordinary folks like you and i won t even stand a chance to buy and (b) i think you got it wrong  you say  mom give the excess to charity so they re not accused of profiteering  way up there in the page is says -  (where anything over rrp will be donated to charity) where do you think this  over rrp  comes from?where do you see mom saying they ll put money from their pocket?it s their customers  pocket   like many people mentioned below  everyone chooses to donate to the charity of their choice as for uk addresses i can only assume the comments that oppose to this are from outside the uk? surely mom is uk based and their profits for the most part come from uk customers  not from international sales this coupled with the fact that there is only a handful of bottles allocated within the uk (most of which are already reserved for rich clientele and high end bars) i don t see what s unfair about it if the us gets its allocation of bottles why should a folk from the states have a chance to buy from the uk site? any uk site for that matter ,

377,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Why Complain ,"i m out, so one less to  concern for the lottery/auction   to those who care, scotch come from scotland, and there is a great variety,  for a great price  if you complaint so bad,  is over price, etc , donâ€™t buy it  uk customers only, relly, you must be a joke, can be take your comment for real  master of malt sales to the word, not just to uk  one more thing, you complainers want to buy that bottle so bad   ",
378,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,All the comments below are hilarious. ,"seriously most of you sound like spoiled children  splitting allocation between a charity (supporting worthwhile causes) and a lottery is fair and equitable  you guys clearly haven t seen how many other retailers have just instantly started selling their stock for double, triple, even 10x the recommended retail price  well done to mom for their model  (just wish they d hurry up with it   surely they have the stock now )also for those saying this should be uk only - haha  mom are a well-respected international retailer and would lose a lot of credibility doing so ",
379,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Stop whining,"life s not fair  get over yourselves everyone so much whining and whingeing, some people on here sound like complete babies   mummy, i didn t get what i wanted today  waaaahhhhhhh    listen to yourselves   all this rubbish about rich people getting priority   that s life   money talks guys, if you want this bottle you gonna pay the market rate which has absolutely nothing to do with whatever release price yamazaki have decieded on ",
380,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Open all the bottles and redistribute it into smaller drams,this way everyone can get a taste and lock out all the secondary market punters  ,
381,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Japanese Whisky,"the problem is with japanese whisky in general  prices have skyrocketed  in recent years as good as japanese whisky might be it is certainly not worth â£200 a bottle let alone $2500 this is purely marketing shenanigans to create artificial demand of course all retailers outside japan are willing to indulge   and jump on the bandwagon i hope buyers will wake up and sabotage any brand or retailer that manipulates prices like that having said that, the sale here should be restricted to uk residents only as for the auction this is a joke @mom if you want to donate to charity do it from your own pocket  don t force it upon your customers ",
382,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,UK Buyers Only,"after the btac fiasco last year, there s no perfect way of allocating these highly sought after bottles, and while it pains me to see uk retailers following the american lottery system, i think this is the best way to allocate bottles, and i commend mom for taking this step  having said that, i agree entirely with the comment below - please mom, if at all possible under eu trade laws restrict the lottery to uk buyers only  there is a huge amount of global demand for this whisky and as one of the most acclaimed online retailers in the world, there will be a huge interest for places in the lottery from all corners of the globe  if i had to guess, i think there will be less than 10 bottles available to the general public to buy in the uk once vip customers, bars and hotels have received their priority allocation, and if this is the case, i think wherever possible, uk retailers should try to ensure british customers are given priority over international customers ",
383,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Hope this will be restricted to UK buyers,"as their are only 198 bottles expected to come into the uk and 2 of the main suppliers have already allocated all of their stock to their vip customers   i can t see there being more than 50 bottles left for your average drinker, with some being auctioned off to people with the deepest pockets there will only be a handful of regular people who manage to get one  ",

391,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,"Equity for your customers, please. ","the only thing really correct for a trader in this situation is the  principle  of equality of its customers  (no discrimination on the basis of their pocket depth ) for this reason i recommend you:1  to keep  stopped the price ($ 300);2  to enable all interested customers to join the lottery;3  to whom will be drawn you will give the opportunity to buy the bottle at its real price ($ 300)  without any increase i am sure it is the only successful way, and, at the same time, i m sure this way will eliminate our negative comments about the auction solution  ",

398,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Retailers should not be auctioning stock,i am afraid that selling these bottles by auction simply fuels the hysteria over japanese whisky at the present time and surely the producers view on the appropriate price should be respected  lottery would be sufficient to ensure fairness ,
399,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Good luck friends,"in the not to distant past, i purchased yamazaki sherry 2009 purchased in hong kong for $93 usd, 2010 version purchased in japan 112 usd  i have contacted 11 stores throughout the us, no luck  probably already sent to the auction block  i thought of entering this lottery, but decided to pass let some of my uk friends get a chance to win   early reviews say its just as mind blowing as the 2013 release  ",
400,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Lotto and Auction ,"i ve been refreshing this site several time an hour for the last few days and on a few of those occasions i saw the price mom is going to sell this bottle for  i called them directly thinking maybe there was a glitch on my side and the bottle had been put up for sale yet i could only see the  coming soon    while i don t agree 100% on the auction, i m ok with it because at least mom isn t jacking up the price like one retailer i found in japan who at least as of 3 days ago had a few bottles in stock and was selling each bottle for $3,600   i even emailed them to confirm the price  their response was,  yes we are selling it for $3,600 american dollars  this is our marketing cost and know people way pay it for such a rare and highly sought out bottle  that online co is dekanta",
401,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Cant agree more,"lottery yes, first come first serve yes, but auction is just playing into the whole marketing hype and inflating the price for no reason  if suntory has suggested a retail price of $300/â£200 then stick to it  the auction will only serve to fuel the secondary market for those buying this for speculative reasons &  investment   i beg you to make the right choice here ",
402,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Auction is bullshit,"i agree with the others in the comments, the auction does nothing for a majority of those here, only the ones with the most money  fail ",
403,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,I call bullshit on a retailer auctioning stock.,"it s bad enough that thanks to the ramblings of a certain panama-hatted, self-proclaimed whisky expert, we re forced to enter a sodding lottery to buy a bottle of whisky, but to put some up for auction is frankly embarrassing  i can only echo the sentiments of other commenters who made the valid point that such an auction is only for those with more money than sense, and it shouldn t be down to an online retailer to decide if we wish to give to charity; it smacks of a publicity stunt  i give to charity on my own terms, and not when i m making a normal online purchase  ",
404,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,How lottery will work,"agree with others here   just stick to it being a lottery  you re only allowing person with most money to buy the bottle otherwise  as someone else suggested, charge a nominal â£1 to enter   also, consider restricting to existing customers and not newly opened accounts   that way, it stops multiple entries, and goes to existing, loyal m0m customers  you could just create a stock item that s  1 per customer , that once purchased if your entry  ",
405,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,"Lottery yes not auction. I managed to get 2 in Australia, but we only got 4 in my state.",should lotto all of them off so everyone has an equal chance or people that want to enter the lottery pay â£1 entry for the chance and that money goes to the charities that means people who s pockets aren t as deep have the same chance ,
406,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,Not Just for the Rich,"i agree, the lottery system is very fair considering the limited amount of bottles produced, and the number of people that want them  but i do not agree with the auction, as previously stated, it will only help the ones with deep pockets       ",
407,Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016,Yamazaki,A whisky for everyone! ,"i agree that the lottery system is the fairest way, but certainly not the auction    firstly, like a lot of people, i give to charity already, and secondly it just means those with the most money will get the bottles   i m positive that s not what yamazaki would have wanted or envisioned for this whisky ",

459,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,"Harmonious, Interesting, Wan","well-blended and interesting enough mixture of the yamazaki and hakushu flavour profiles (apricots, grass, something floral), but overly light and too marred by the grain  a higher abv and pure malt might go some way to correcting its failings  not really worth getting over the rather superb individual malts, in fact a non-starter with the recent price inflation ",
460,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Not good,"no, it did not work for me  my mistake, as i prefer single malt, but i let myself be convinced by the guy a the duty free counter, and bought this as i wanted to try something from the japanese market  i am sorry but nothing special  lovely bottle, though, which i will keep  as i am re-reading the marketing blurb at the back of the box i can translate it in two ways: let s just mix everything together and sell it for a fortune, or let sit down and produce something harmonious and lovely  lovely indeed, but nothing special ",
461,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Powerful and harmonious in the mouth. ,"with a golden color and sparkling bright, the hibiki is a beautiful whisky  in the nose, it shows an awesome harmony, although it lacks intensity  in the mouth it has again a big harmony with a quite diverse range of flavors, but lacks on structure and personality, being just a very pleasent blend  would recommend for someone who is searching a japanese blend ",
462,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,A worthy bottle to your collection,"i think prices are going up due to the hype   i picked one up for $69 after tasting a flight of japanese whiskies in a local whisky house   on the nose, the whisky is very floral with notes of sandal wood and sharp fruit, which is almost nail polish like, but in a pleasant way   on the tongue, the whisky is light with lingering sweetness   subtle notes of malt and peat come through on the mid-palate   i appreciate subtle flavors in both foods and spirits and really like this whisky   have this in your collection to appreciate the range of different styles whiskies can offer   note that it s not going to be as powerful as your islays or some bourbons   ",
463,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Too expensive,a tasty whiskey which has gone up from â£50 to â£65 in the last 18 months i won t buy it again at that price there are many other great whiskies out there at much lower prices ,
464,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Nice . Smooth .easy drinking. ,nice but not a classic   very young but easy going in the palet  don t not add water it will kill this whiskey  got as a present and glad i did   i read reports that the price was going up so i brought myself a second bottle for â£48 not worth  â£65 ,
465,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Marketing Ploy,"at first i thought i tasted a hint of subtlety, but after making it further through my ounce it started to drink like a slightly more balanced irish whisky (not a good thing) at a much lower price-point it would be an acceptable whisky, but i m afraid suntory has dressed up a sub-par dram in a nice bottle and box and called it  premium   avoid unless you re only buying an ounce ",
466,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Breathe it in,so nice  big fan of this  almost prefer to sniff it than drink it  cuts calories and more affordable  ,
467,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,best blend you will find in the current era,"if not for the 12 and 17 year old versions existing this hibiki is the best blend around at the moment  it has so much to offer to all, whether you have tried whisky for the first time recently or are a seasoned drinker  this nas hibiki may have some younger malts than the 12 year old did, but i wouldn t be surprised if it had older too  its well balanced, friendly and accessible but   never boring  may be a little pricey, but it is unique experience indeed noselots of dried fruit notes including plum, raisin, apricot and perhaps a hint of fruit conserve  vanilla and floral notes  there is a pickled note in here, not unpleasantly so, but just a little acidity complemented by a marmalade note, cacao and a very faint hint of peat palettesweet wood notes, vanilla, honey develops into a warm spice rich apple and orange note before finishing with some oak woodiness and spiciness, some over-brewed tea and a faint passing note of peat  (disclaimer, tasting notes are subjective)   ",
468,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,not a bad drop of whisky,"i m not a whisky buff or a toff, i have had some bunnahabhains and the shackleton journey and discovery whiskiesall god damn fine whisky s and all i can say is its distressing that this doesn t come in a 1 litre version, 50cl is just not enough,  but happy to have it in my cabinet, its really nice n fresh to drink, i dont add coke   i dont add water, damn i dont even add ice, i drink my whisky how its poured straight into the glass and then my mouth",
469,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,underwhelming ,"with a blend of both yamasazki and hakistu  you can actully taste both at the exact same time  the problem is it is on where near a good as i was led to belive  if you already have yamaski and hakisu, there is really no need to to get this one  ",
470,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Muah!,"a little bit pricey but one of the best blend s i ve been drinking alot of flavours, caramel, orange peel and alot of more flavours   i have to try another whisky now so have to end the review right now  ",
471,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Well balanced whisky for all tastes.,smooth  a good whisky  very well balanced  ,
472,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Great whisky easy drinking ,great whisky very easy drinking  however the taste is almost identical to glenmorangie a mid winters night which is half the price  cool bottle though  ,
473,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,"Excellent whisky, well worth it. ","if smoky peaty briny single malts are winter, then the hibiki harmony is spring  it is light, sweet, bright, fool of fruit   that citrusy influence that is just   yummy  there are very few whiskies even close in price point that i would rank with this one  ",
474,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,One of the most elegant whiskies I ve ever drank. ,"by far one of the most elegant whiskies  i enjoy it straight with just a splash of cold water  i smell orange, a bit of chocolate and toffee  very smooth taste with a sweet buttery end  it is complex but not too complex and medium strong  ",
475,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Very pleased with this offering,"while this blend from hibiki does remain smooth from start to finish, it also has a pleasing complexity that makes you want to taste it again  it has a nice finish that lingers softly, which i like, allowing you to easily continue to drink it  i was never one to try and pinpoint every last flavor detail - i leave that to those with a more refined palate, than i  what i value is a whisky that tastes great and is a pleasure to drink in the overall experience  i find that hibiki japanese harmony is exactly that ",
476,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Beautiful!,"this is a beautiful whiskey  it is smooth, delicious, sweet and well worth the price  ",
477,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,"Scottish whisky drinker,  + years ","we opened the bottle and poured a few glassed it smelt really good , we drank it and it also tasted really good   then we had a glass of our local scottish whisky , then i decided to taste the japanese whisky again  but  we were all very surprised and shocked to find it was not pleasant to drink after having a scottish whisky  very disappointed ???? fw",
478,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,"Smooth, Smokey & buttered. ",such a lovely whiskey  very easy to drink  love it on ice  ,
479,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Whiskey lover,"for the price, it is the best japanese whiskey out there ",
480,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Car without a motor,"having a get together with the boys  i originally wrote a report on this that was not favourable and said i would let it breathe and report back again  here it is from the group: very fruity, cherries and bananas but rather flat overall  no life, no social redeeming value   lack of risk from the distiller  the question was  would you buy it?  and the overwhelming response was no  ",
481,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Sweetened high octane vomit,the bottle i got with the japanese advent calendar is hopefullt just off  because this stuff hadn t a light smoky nose and the flavor of cat vomit   every sip resulted in gagging   had two friends over who are avid whiskey drinkers that tasted it with the same reaction   group vote was to pour it out  i spent all evening trying to choke it down hoping it would get better   it didn t  ,
482,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Not a fan,"when i first opened the bottle all i could smell was rubbing alcohol  first glass was not a pleasant experience at all  very young   sharp, soapy and lacking in flavour  let it sit for a while and had another glass a few weeks later and although it settled down it still lacks character in my opinion  having the boys over for a scotch night before xmas and will report back with some more thoughts ",
483,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Malaysian.,on its own not much alcohol taste but very smooth  please mix with yamazaki limited edition 2016 and it becomes fantastic  2 spoonful of each and the formula is just right ,
484,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Hibiki by the name,honestly this hibiki is very disapointing  flat and short ,
485,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Short lived & Non-complex,"young wet wood, very floral, decadent marmalade, spice, vanilla, sugar sweet but thin, short finish  nice sweet & spicy taste with wood and flowers for aroma  i bit thin and the finish i d short  complexity seems to stop at the nose and the taste is a bit of a sweet mess  reminds me of a brandy  my rating comes down to this  am i excited to run to my kitchen and gave another dram of it? no  would i buy it again? nope ",
486,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Smooth and sweet with the right complexity enjoyale to drink  this pic,"probably one of the better  blended i have tasted at this mid tier range  if smoky scotch isn t for you, this is the one to go for     ",
487,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,VERY SMOOTH,recommended  highly,
488,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,VERY VERY SMOOTH,recommended,
489,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Surprisingly good,"the initial nose is i think oak and orange together  followed by more pronounced orange and peppery oak, which is in turn followed by notes of vanilla from the depths  there isn t even the barest hint of alcohol on the nose  the palate is again oak and oranges, followed by orange candy, with some medicinal orange notes  there are only the barest hints of alcohol here, and barely any bite, until the finish the finish is dry with some hints of toffee showing up in an airing of oranges ",
490,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Worth the price,"pricier than some great single malts (laphroaig, ardbeg, arran), but this is a beautiful blend  fruity, complex,  smoky, and smooth with a pleasant, numbing bite at the finish  think of a smokier, fruitier version of arran 10 ",
491,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Initially skeptical - totally won me over after several sessions,"dismissed by many due to its price point as a blend - don t overlook this incredibly light, smooth and floral whisky  less sweet, more fruity (orange, spice, wood cone through) - don t let the snobs put you off with their wearisome complaints that it  lacks in complexity  and is  too sweet   on the contrary, i d say this is pure, understated complexity and elegance  give it a chance - you won t be disappointed  ",
492,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,very nice and smooth,was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and tasty it was,
493,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Cloying Sweet,"after trying the hakushu 12yr as my first japanese whisky and being blown away, i was eager to try more offerings from suntory s distilleries  the hibiki japanese harmony was the next bottle i grabbed  the nose is promising, slightly floral, with more warmth and spice than the hakushu  i got slightly woody smells in the nose, but none of the cirtrus or smoke of the hakushu  smells very inviting on the palate sweetness dominates everything  it tasted as if someone dropped a dollop of honey directly on my tongue before the whiskey comes through  with even the sweetest bourbon, there is generally enough body and flavor to support the sweetness  after the honey there are some interesting and pleasant tasting notes in this whisky, especially those that you can get on the exhale after a good sip  but all the tasting notes here are demure and restrained and subtle, and simply do not stand up to the overwhelming sweetness  at best hibiki might make a great base for a minimalist cocktail or whisky and club soda  at worst it is simply medicinal in taste and lacking most of the virtues of the other fantastic japanese whiskys i ve tasted ",
494,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,one of the best blended whisky s i ve tasted ,
495,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,hibiki japanese harmony,"a truly delicious whiskey smooth and satisfying even when the nectar has been enjoyed,the glass continues to have a delightful nose of oak and spicy sandalwood ",
496,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Wow,caramel   almond   toffee   sweet stuff   a little salty  simple mid palate but really smooth and terrific for the price  i like it better than yamazaki 12 year and nikka pure malt  great whisky for under $75  ,
497,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Mike,"i had never tried japanese whiskey before; master of malt led me to japanese harmony  thank you     it s, without doubt, one of the tastiest, most memorable whiskeys i ve ever had the privilege to savour  ",
498,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Not as good as Hibiki 12,   and a pale shadow of the hibiki 17 :-(the nose is promising but the palate and finish is a little unbalanced (dare i say unharmonious?)saddens me it s almost impossible to find a bottle of hibiki 17 or even hibiki 12 nowadays ,

500,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,This is a great whisky ,super smooth flavour,
501,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Fabulous whiskey ,a super smooth flavour very enjoyable light n lovely one of my favourites ,
502,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Mmmmm....,"   not sure about this one  on the plus side, it has lovely fruit fragrance, with herby and woody notes  it has a pleasant mouth feel but the strongest impression is sweetness, and a little too much of this   ",
503,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Very good,caramel nose  lots of orange on first taste but less thereafter  vanilla and floral  oaky finish   pleased,
504,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Eager to taste,based on what i ve heard this should be a satisfying whisky,
505,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Interesting!,"nose is mostly plum   i also got white chocolate on the cork  palate continues to be very fruity, flowery    i did not get orange, but more like apricot  a note i could not place till i read the review that said hibiscus   that s it   a touch of malt  finish is a bit woody, burnt almost? i see that many have given kinda low ratings    the thing to remember is that this is a blend, not a malt  you rarely see this kind of complexity in a blend  so all good with me, you don t like the flavor profile, that s one thing   doesn t mean the whisky is bad, so long as it does what it sets out to do   however, this is my second japanese whisky and i ll say this    this is definitely not as good as the nikka from the barrel  ",
506,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Awesome Blend!,"not usually a fan of blended whiskey, but this one set me on my ear  ",
507,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Smooth n nice flavour ,super ,
508,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Excellent and Light,"looking at those mediocre reviews i compared  hibiki 17 and nikka whiskey from the barrel and light harmony all japanese whiskys  light harmony is an excellent light whiskey that can be served to all, even those who try whiskey for the very first time and women are included no one will be turned off  many whiskey connoisseurs lost their taste to stinky taste of peat like laphroaig or smoky lagavulin if you like to try light refreshing whisky without strong aftertaste look no further ",
509,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,The Art for money,a good balance between the 12 & the 21 year ,
510,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,"Light, floral notes, but lingering sweetness is overwhelming.","a whisky with an inviting nose, notes of honey, hibiscus, and subtle vanilla   upon first taste all other senses are overwhelmed by the sweet taste that remains   some 30 minutes after completing my dram it still feels like i have a lollipop in my mouth   texture is thin   in all honesty, i expected more ",
511,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Excellent,simply one of the best,
512,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Floral whisky,unique  floral  certainly not smokey  is smooth but could give a hangover unlike scottish scothches   ,
513,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Almost Drinkable,"so sweet  kind of tastes like cough syrup, orange peel and a stale caramel  first sip   ok, this is different  second sip   not sure if i like this  third sip   yuck, give me something to rinse my palate and give me some real whiskey so that my taste buds don t sue me for abuse this is an embarrassing whiskey for suntory  i hope that it gets pulled from the shelves soon because it is giving them a bad name ",
514,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,So-so at best,"color: rich and deep in amber character, but clearly contains caramel due to the hue of the whisky: in conjunction with the flavor, which is curiously sweet and does not linger on the tongue, i m convinced there is caramel coloring in the drink  aroma: fruity with notes of pear and banana, very delicate notes of marshmallow and caramelized sugars; notes of toasted cinnamon and raisin bread, but very subdued  there is an aspect of charcoal but also very subdued and does not present alongside the phenolic notes of the malt, but rather with the more fruity flavor as would be found with a bourbon  overall, the nose is lacking in pungency and has no truly distinctive notes over many other less expensive japanese blends taste and texture: texture is thicker than ardbeg and coats that glass in a pleasant way, but the taste is forgettable and doesn t linger in the mouth nearly long enough to be pleasurable  the flavors themselves immediately remind me of nikka from the barrel (51%) but without the distinction and pungency of nikka s honey flavor both of suntory s malts, hakushu and yamazaki, present strongly in japanese harmony, but their effect is less pleasant than in the 12 year old hibiki: the hakushu blend, which is exceptionally sweet and has notes of pine and earthy flavors not found in other peated whiskys like ardbeg or laphraoig, is overwhelmed by the acidity and acridness of the yamazaki malt, which tends to be more spicy and possesses the cinnamon characteristics that present in japanese harmony  the end result is a whiskey has the potential to be fantastic, but falls short in terms of the potency and longevity of the flavor in the mouth  would not recommend; would recommend in its place the hibiki 12 which has more palatable honey notes, nikka from the barrel (51%) which has rounder fruity profiles as well as a more distinct and pleasant fruit notes, or hakushu 12 which is surprisingly refreshing and has exceptionally balanced flavor profile between sweet and earthy ",
515,Hibiki Japanese Harmony,Hibiki,Quite nice,"quite smooth and not peaty   a bit on the floral / fruit side  a touch of burn that goes down with a sip   absolutely enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it   other than that it was a bit pricey, i would strongly suggest it to others   ",

522,Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master s Select,Hibiki,Expensive for what it is,"not worth the price  sweetness overrules  i got some metallic taste as well, probably from use of younger whiskies  overall itâ€™s just nothing special  ",
523,Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master s Select,Hibiki,Great  newbie  whisky,"bought a bottle on a trip with some friends, and the smooth, slightly sweet taste fits perfectly for me, as i am very new to whisky, and it is the first bottle i ve picked up for myself  can definitely recommend it to anyone that is not too fond of smoke, and/or unsure where to start ",
524,Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master s Select,Hibiki,Plain and ordinary whisky,"bought a bottle at changi  drank it over 6 months  initially not too bad, however it got painful to drink this whisky  it is just an ordinary whisky  other single malts costing less than this are far better value definitely not buying any more of the suntory  drop down mixes its a shame because the yamazaki single malt 12 year old is a smashing whisky",
525,Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master s Select,Hibiki,Outstanding & surprisingly sophisticated blend,"picked up a bottle after being offered a taste at otopeni airport (bucharest, ro)  the well balanced, delicate flavour combinations along with a very smooth finish were an absolute revelation to me, as i was only accustomed to scottish and american brands i didn t hesitate to make the purchase at about 70eu, which i think was a steal for this kind of quality highly recommended if you haven t tried japanese whisky before   ",

547,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Wow,"i thought the 12 was good but this is something else   smooth long finish with custard cream and rhubarb on the nose, hints of cherry and plums in there as well   this is an adult version of your favourite childhood cordial   however i m not sure it s worth that much more than the 12   certainly smoother but i think i d prefer two 70cl of the 12 rather than one of these  ",
548,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Could smell it all day!,"it s interesting to read how different people describe this whisky so differently  for me, the nose was of full of fruit, in particular dark cherries  fantastic  the palate is sweet and velvety smooth with more fruit/cherry giving way to a bit of vanilla spiciness & oaken body  more please ",
549,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,The nose is in a league of its own,"a cracking whisky, much better than many single malts at the same price  probably my favourite bottle design too, and such a sweet, easy-drinking dram    ",

552,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Shared with good friends and...,"it just doesn t get much better always a fan of the single malts, this is without a doubt worthy, despite the name (scotch) omission  splendid cheers",
553,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Sublime,"like any good whisky, this gets better the more you taste  wonderful spice on the nose, clean, fresh slightly woody taste, and very long spicy finish  sublime stuff indeed  i ve never been to japan, but this brings to mind some of the tastes and smells i would expect if i visited   very clever, and very japanese   wet wood, flowers gardens after rain, and a fragrance that is so sensual  and as a little bonus, it comes in a very stylish bottle indeed  highly recommended without reservation  ",
554,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Wow,"have just stacked this up against my favourite scotch - a talisker dark storm, which i thought was a bit of an improvement over the original, and this hibiki just demolishes it  very mellow and straightfoward  the talisker was brutal, but then i like them harsh  this was anything but - a real pleasure to sip on, and you can taste the effort they put into it  i ve tried a few japanese scotches, all the way up to the yamazaki 25, which was a bit treacley, but as it was the dowry for my wife, it served its purpose and went down well  i would still rate this hibiki 17 well above it  these guys did a great job  enjoy  ",

561,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Suntory Gold,"this is my 2nd review of this whiskey, and for good reason it s initial impact is citrus followed quickly by sweeter honey tones, the after taste lingers long enough to satisfy but short enough not to intrude  the blend that s achieved puts a certain blue label to shame and, quite easily at that i enjoy a peaty whiskey emensely, of which this isn t but it does deliver on every scale, the price you pay respects the drink you drink, if you re at all unsure, please take the plunge, if you re not happy ill come to yours and drink the remainder for you ",

563,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,97/100,"i did not expect to like this as much as i have, sipping on some now   the nose is unique to anything i have had before - spice and floral blossom alongside pine and oak with beeswax, one of the most interesting noses that will have you inhaling it for a long time, there are tones of smoke, and leaf alongside notes of rich vanilla and citrus leaf   the taste is as good, an initial intense spice with chili leads into a more beguiling sensation of baked tropical fruits, bananas toffee, slight peaty smokiness which i wasn t expecting, more spice and eventual mellowing over well balanced cream, spice and fruit   i can t  believe how good this is, almost as good as some of my favourite scottish single malts   and better than a lot of the scottish blends   unbelievable   ",

566,Hibiki 17 Year Old,Hibiki,Good and Unique,"a review by tommy byrneoverall rating: 7,5/10 - good and uniqueas many western whisky enthusiasts, i discovered the suntory whisky brand a few years ago thanks to bill murrayâ€™s sells pitch in sofia coppolaâ€™s lost in translations: â€œfor relaxing times, make it suntory timeâ€  having first tried the yamazaki 12 years old single malt, i had huge expectations from the brand who made me forget it was not actually drinking a true scotch whisky swirling in my very favourite glencairn glass, the old gold fluid already let you know you are dealing with an almost full body whisky  starting with some dried bananas and apricots nosing notes, honeydew and pineapple soon appear after the first sip  while the toasted barley and dry fruits blends in with balance to an insinuation of toffee in the palate, i found it a little too sharp for a 17 years old whisky  however, the addition of a drop of water will definitely make up for it  reaching the finishing line, we know we are dealing with a fine-aged product, it last remarkably in the mouth, reminding you that you are drinking a hundred dollar whisky iâ€™ve never been a strong fan of scotch-type blended whiskies; they always seem to lack of a true essence and hide their original personality  why blend this sweet nectar with an obscure array of distilled spirits, when the angels delightfully take their shares in the untainted form? then again, letâ€™s be clear, the 17 years old version of suntory hibiki is a great product made with a thorough process by japanese master blenders who have perfectly reproduced the style and character of a speyside whisky to my sense  being an unconditional devotee to islay malts, i think that a stronger hint of peat would really transform this whisky into what some have already branded it: â€œthe best whisky in the worldâ€ ",

581,Hibiki 21 Year Old,Hibiki,"Delicious, hands down my favorite blend by a long shot","absolutely incredible stuff, a big step up from the already excellent 17yo, it s hard to describe just how balanced and delicious this whisky is  the nose is sweet, nutty, with vanilla, toffee and some sherry  the mouthfeel is so smooth, and there s a beautiful mix of fruity sweetness, caramel, oak and just a hint of smoke on the palate, all balanced in perfect proportion  a nice long, oaky finish that stays with you for a good while  i ve tried other blends including the much touted jw blue, but honestly there is no contest between it and hibiki 21, and that s no exaggeration  every bit as good as its reputation, and well worth trying if you every find yourself with the opportunity to do so  unfortunately this is nearly impossible to find in a liquor store these days, and if you do find it it will be at a substantial (>$500 usd) markup, but if you see it at a bar and have $100 to burn, treat yourself to a glass, you won t be disappointed ",

642,Hibiki 12 Year Old,Hibiki,The Japanese beauty that turned my head!,"i m a usamerican, and (admittedly) a  snob  when it comes to malt-based liquor; i won t drink whiskey unless it s from the island of ireland, and -- until now -- i wouldn t drink scotch whisky unless it was from scotland  (the bourbon-type liquors sold under those monikers by north american producers is, in my experience and to my palate, too inferior to deserve the name ) but when my spouse and i went to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants recently, the server mentioned they had recently added  a japanese scotch  to their offerings, and we were too intrigued not to inquire further  the bartender brought over the lovely decanter, i asked to smell the cork    and it was love at first whiff   we enjoyed a dram of it together (neither of us are remotely heavy drinkers) and found it to make an excellent  sipping whiskey  with its profound complexity and warm sweetness  that it could have done with a touch less  fire  is my only criticism; though it s entirely possible my palate had simply grown unaccustomed to  neat  liquor again, as i mainly imbibe scotch and whiskey in the colder months, when i drink it at all  though my preference is always for unadulterated scotch and whiskey, i did try the hibiki 12 year old with water after a while, and the completely different array of complexly-layered flavors and aroma made me fall in love all over again   i can t recommend this blend highly enough -- for those who enjoy fine scotch and/or whiskey in the first place -- and will definitely consider acquiring a bottle of my own    even though, at the rate i drink, it would likely last a lifetime ",
643,Hibiki 12 Year Old,Hibiki,Well worth the money!,"beautiful decanter for a bottle and the juice inside is worthy of such a sexy bottle  oranges, marmalade and plums, nutty honey & sponge cake  ",

645,Hibiki 12 Year Old,Hibiki,George - Hibiki 12,"sophisticated and exotic, hibiki exudes the most wonderful collection of aromas and tastes  as a student, this one is very special and it will be a while before i can work my up through the range but if this is anything to go by, it will be worth the wait   nose: spring blossom and green freshness  notes of plum and exotic spices (lotus, ginger?)  hint of raspberry, honey and sweet maltiness  palate: strong but subtle, extremely fragrant and sweet, balanced by spicy ginger and oak notes  lively and velvet smooth with defined vanilla and honey notes  cereal sweetness is held in check by more robust oak and rich exotic fruitiness, particularly raspberry and plum  finish: very long, sweet with an enduring spiciness - you are left in no doubt that you have had something very special     ",
646,Hibiki 12 Year Old,Hibiki,Wow,"firstly the bottle i thought was very impressive but what got me most was the nose, seriously i couldn t stop smelling it the taste was very busy, but in a remarkable manner layer s of taste s going back to the nose, i got bag s of rum and raison ice creamthe vanilla was abundant smooth clean taste, distinctive to the japanese i just loved it, smiled with every sniff and taste            stephen mcgiff,      cornwall      ",

650,Hibiki 12 Year Old,Hibiki,delicious ,"i ve tasted a few japanese drams so far and none were disappointing   this one was the best by far this hibiki 12 year old is a so-called premium blend, because it contains (besides grain whisky as packer) no less than 30 different single malts that are at least 12 years of age, topped off with a 30-year old   the dram has matured on japanese oak first and finished in so-called umeshu cask, previously used for the maturing of japan s famous plum brandy the whole went through a process of charcoal filtering - through bamboo wood no less - that gives the whole it s mellow, soft taste it was launched in 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of suntory hibiki distillery the influence of the umeshu cask is clearly detectable on the nose  apart from plum, raspberry and pineapple, one also gets hit by very sweet honey and a truckload of vanilla on the palate, a duel is going on between the oak and the barley  what a body  very good indeed the finish is nicely spiced and long  the sweet oak prevents the dram from burning down your throat mmmm very moreish the word  hibiki  has several meanings in japanese, one of them being  harmonious   that s a good way to describe this premium blend  available at other retailers for around â£45 ",
651,Hibiki 12 Year Old 50cl,Hibiki,Totally Tropical Taste,"my initial impression took me back to asia - fresh fruits like pineapple that have been ripening in the tropical sun      definitely a different experience to what i have had before   very well-balanced and there is a  plummyness  that really comes through   most enjoyable - however, it must be said my bottle was a gift - would i pay â£40 for it?  no - which is a shame  ",

667,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,Too Good,"this whisky was so good i drank two thirds of the bottle in one night (very unlike me), woke up the next morning with a raging hangover and now i can t touch the stuff would definitely recommend to anyone who has never had a japanese whisky but doesn t have the budget for a yamazaki or the 12 yo, different to any scotch/irish/other single malt  it s also probably worth splashing out on even if it s slightly outside your usual budget (like it was mine) as i can t think of a single scotch in this price range which beats it ",

670,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,JB,terrible sharpness  i m not a whisky drinker normally but have recently had some single malts from scotland  they ve been  smooth   this is rough,
671,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,All things green. ,"this great japanese single malt is full of all things green on both the nose and palate  green fruits, herbs, mint, melon and cucumber abound  the nose is a delightful green medley of more things than i can easily discern  it s utterly mouthwatering on the tongue and any smoke is very light and not easy to detect  not cheap by any means but a great entry level japanese single malt  highly recommended   ",
672,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,Look out Scotland!,"the chill from the japanese alps, a shy taste of smoke  great  ",
673,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,A  Smokey Speyside ,"this whisky is light, smooth, and mellow, with all the attributes of a glenmorangie nectar d or (honey/lemon) on the palate, but with a subtle smokey finish  delightful  ",
674,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,A superb drop for the money...,"   with some delicate and very unusual fruit flavours that you just don t find in a scotch malt coming through at the end, possibly as a result of the mizunara oak  and whilst it s not exactly ardbeg, if the reviewer below can t detect the peat (or the fruit, for that matter) he needs his tastebuds examined, and if anyone thinks this is too sweet i can only guess that they ve never tasted a speyside or sherried whisky before  i m guessing restraint and subtlety just aren t his things  ",
675,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,Sugared almonds,"nearing the end of the bottle (shows how easy it is to drink) but i wont buy again  zero green notes, citrus/ cucumber etc, zero peat  what there is in abundance is coconut ice, maple syrup fudge, golden syrup - its just too sugary for me says it all when m o m conclude their tasteing notes suggesting it would make a greta highball ",
676,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,lapin rouge,"entry level (8 yrs?) malt - so there is an edge to it and very little complexity  dont believe any of the marketing-speak about  green herbs   yuzu  or  cucumber  - but maybe, perhaps there is smoke on the finish if you imagine really hard the reality is it s an excellent drinking whiskey, a well deserved glass in the evening  and maybe another glass after that  thoroughly enjoyable ",
677,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,Nice with a capital  N ,"think of a bath of hot water to soak in  some you lower yourself gently into as you need to get used to it before you enjoy it  you know the style 2/3 tastes maybe more  the you go haaaaaaaa nice this is a single malt that has already been checked tested and you just get in there and soak from the 1st sip to getting out clean and refreshed it s japanese precision  personally no hidden corners, no shocks, no surprises however don t get me wrong it s comfort incarnate  favourite film,slippers and music score    ",
678,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,A good alternative Hakushu,"a good alternative to the 12 year old, this can be had for as little as â‚¬20-25 if you search out alternative off-licences and suburban department stores in tokyo and its environs  quite an accomplished whisky for the price and perhaps even a little less ubiquitous than its bigger and more expensive 12 year old brother ",
679,The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distillerâ€™s Reserve,Hakushu,like bathing in a Japanese spring,"perfectly described, seriously good drop very easy to get stuck into the peat delicately arrives after lashings of mint and melon, mmmmmsteve mcgiff    cornwall  ",
680,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Great Japanese Whisky,"hakushu 12, unlike the yamazaki 12 & discontinued hibiki & yoichi 12 yr olds, is still somewhat available in the u s  (specifically california)   overall, i find the subtle hints of smokiness on the nose & palate (really not a whole lot of smoke) make hakushu 12 much more interesting and enjoyable than other japanese whiskies in the same price range   the subtle peat smoke lingers in the background and really enhances all the mostly fruity notes that dominate   probably a great teaser for the uninitiated of the joys that peated whisky can bring  ",
681,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,An especially nice whisky,"given the eye-watering prices these days i sometimes suspect producers are taking the mick  would have thought this well worth fifty quid, however, but then again itâ€™s more to my taste than highland park 18 at a comparable price and not far behind my favourite balvenie 21 at much more   ",
682,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Great whiskey!,"this is a great whisky  the japaneses oak offers a rich and unique taste that you will not find in other whiskeys  it s something to savor  if your used to irish, scotch, american  you will be glad of the experience  ",
683,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,A Japanese forest in a bottle,intense flavors of forest and spice with a nice subtle smoke lingering  great stuff but it comes at a price  is it worth the price of most 18yo bottles out there? maybe     worth a try for anyone who likes stuff like glenfiddich  this is my go to when i want a clean fresh scotch  id give it a 5 but that is reserved for a scotch that makes me want to never drink anything else ,
684,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Good whiskey to try. ,"nice flavor, very light and smooth compared to some other single malts  i d say it is a good buy at or around $50  i wouldn t pay higher than that  ",
685,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,pretty good,"not bad at allcould be smoothersmells/tastes of oak, clove & honeygot mine for ~$60",
686,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,"Outstanding, refreshing ","i don t know all of those big words that the experts use, but i save this for special occasions, when the snow is falling and the fire is crackling  having climbed my fuji, i m a big fan of this unbelievably tasty japanese whiskey         love it, and distinctly original  ",
687,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Love this whisky,cheers,
688,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Superb!,got both yamazaki and hakushu 12 years  brilliant whisky  get it and try before it gets discontinued  ,
689,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,What a fresh Nose!,"i just bought a bottle of  hakushu 12 to celebrate the birth of my 2nd child and daughter and decided on this whisky   man, am i impressed  probably the freshest nose i ve experienced   i always roll my eyes when people nose a whisky and then say something silly like,  smells of a rolling meadow   blah blah blah    but his whisky   wow, consider me a changed man   i actually felt like the nose transported me to a quiet japanese forest   i found the taste to be clean, just sweet enough and just peaty enough   kinda like a sweet terpentine (if that sounds good at all to you   which it probably shouldnt?)  after a minute or so of airing out, it became an amazingly smooth drink   the harsh edge of the peat rolled off a bit and it transformed into something gulpable - which i wouldnt consider the cost  but all in all, i am impressed and this will for sure be a staple in cabinet  ",
690,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Bamboo Charcoal filtered,i think the hakushu whiskies have  a very distinct and original profile and are the ones that least resemble scotch of all the japanese i ve tasted so far at first it was a bit rough but it rally opens up halfway after a few months   ,
691,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Just Delightful,"i did a blind tasting of the distillers reserve, 12 year, and 18 year old hakushu   the 12 year was the clear winner of the three for me   the 12 year was more delicate and had more subtle under notes and layers than the other two   this will always be a staple in my world whiskey collection  ",
692,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Excellent ,"there seems to be a lot of reviewers with elementary grammar commenting on these specialized whiskys, the truth is you may spend good money on on a well crafted whisky you simply don t like, it s all it the eye of the taster, but before you tear down a finely crafted product like hakushu you should take more time to understand the complexity of regional whisky ",
693,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,my goto 12,price point is high due to popularity  but this is my go to 12 year old  ,
694,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Too much expensive!!,"very too much expensive for these quality  of course, a nice product, but not at this price  yes, it is subtle, fruity   and taste good  but i refuse to buy speculative whiskey ",
695,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Beautiful,"this is the first japanese wiskey i ve tried (but i have lots of experience of scotch), it s absolutely wonderful    i adore coal ila, and bruichladdich   this is right up their with them   hard to say it s worth $75 a bottle, but it s definitely a lovely whiskey  ",
696,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Expensive,too expensive for a 12 year japanese whisky  not good at all ,
697,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,very refined for a 12 year old.,"a bowmore, ehhhhh          the hakushu is much more subtle and layered, perfect for a clear, cool day, or a rainy night and you re inclined to calm things down with the essence & aroma of  the gentle forest breeze, slightly pear fruity, hints of almond, fresh grass and clean, clear water from the alps  this is refined whisky, not really for those who enjoy their jack daniels with coke ",
698,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,overrated,too expensive and it doesn t feel like a 12 yo at all  get a bowmore 12 instead  half the price and you get a well rounded whisky that doesn t taste like alcohol  i have tried plenty of japanese whisky and this one of the worst ,
699,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Mmmmm,fantastic   but with ice   its only then the flavors explode       ,
700,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Smooth,i received three bottles of the 12 year hakushu  one of the best gifts i ve received by far when it comes to whiskey ,
701,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,great taste ,its sweet with less burn than yamazaki 12  great 12yr and an alternative to  yamazaki 12 if u want the same taste with less bite,
702,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Great Whiskey ,i received three bottles of the 12 year old hakushu and was hesitant on opening it up  it was one of the best decisions i ve made ,
703,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Loved it! ,i was a little hesitant when i bought this due to the mixed reviews  i have absolutely no regrets after taking my first sip  it is smokey but light enough to drink without adding any water  it grows on you  the taste & smell gets better with each sip  ,
704,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Suntory has done it again.,"a very fresh whiskey, little gras, gently smoky, with water the tastes comes through and you can almost feel the alp air no scot comes even close  sorry ",
705,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Fresh and teriffic,"this is all beach-grass with a bonfire off in the distance   wish i had a yamazaki to taste against, but on its own, just terrific   no sherry cloying, smoke only the very faintest, none of the  whiskey distillery  taste that you get in even the lightest oban and scapa scotches   seriously, it s all a day at a secluded beach   really like nothing i ve ever had before   underappreciated imo   it s $65 in texas and well worth it   at $110 i d still even consider it, just for its simplicity and uniqueness ",
706,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Amazing,"i drank this with glenlivet 12, glenfiddich 12 and the winner was hakushu 12  cant beleve that this guy s age is only 12 omg",
707,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Chief,"i don t believe it   upon opening the bottle and pouring, two comments from about the room were to the effect  what stinks ? not only does it have a strong odor, but also really a lot of bite  might be better at 40% (80 proof) texas single malt whisky and inexpensive single malt irish and scotch are much more enjoyable ",
708,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,Fantastic!,it was a long time ago since i had a really new experience in the malt world    just trye it and enjoy  ,
709,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,great intro to Japanese Whiskey,"brand new to japanese whiskey, but a lover of both irish and scotch whiskey, this is very good whiskey  i agree with above review, i would have thought this whiskey would run more than it is  very good, as mention no water needed with  thumbs up   ",
710,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,How much?,"after trying this in a restaurant at the weekend, i genuinely thought this was a whisky worth â£100 or more  â£55 is a bargain  i can tell you that this whisky compares excellently with the smoother peaty expressions from islay or campbeltown  the smell alone is worth the entry fee  ",
711,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,"Sweet, smooth goodness","this is a sweet and smooth whisky with gentle, easy notes  easy sipping  no water needed  love it ",
712,Hakushu 12 Year Old,Hakushu,what a 12yo!,"what a cracking little malt this is  very fresh and crisp, the smoke is very subtle and comes to the fore over the time of the drink - it builds and builds but is light and really compliments the lightness of the drink  lovely thick mouthfeel, and medium finish which is sweet  this is now my top summer whisky and possibly the best 12 year old i ve ever had  complexity of a malt much, much old   maybe up there with 18yo s",
713,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,Amazing,"great whisky  has smell of wood, fruit, and caramel  has taste of wood, caramel, and smoke  slightly cheaper alternative to yamazaki 18 ",
714,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,A big fan of Hakushu 18,hakushu is really underrated  it s very underrated compare to yamasaki  hakushu 18 is one of my favourite  it s seriously good  ,
715,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,Surprising for someone whos not a fan of the 12,"i never really rated hakushu 12  it was decent but a bit harsh and no where near as harmonious as say a hibiki or a taketsuru   this made the 18 a revelation   smooth and caremelly with a fruity nose, it was an absolute delight  however, once my ice melted into it sub stantially, the nose went off and chemical notes started coming in  thus only 4 stars",
716,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,Reasonably good,while i dont think it is as great as many make it out to be this is a really nice whisky,
717,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,Turning Japanese...,"   i really think so more and more i discover these wonderful japanese whiskies, after a disastrous tasting of a yoichi in scotland last year  i am now convinced that was an unfortunate one-off, as everything i ve sampled recently has been a revelation  this is sharp, fresh, lingering sweetness, apples, pears, and fresh cut flowers  just gorgeous, clean and deeply tasty  recommended ",
718,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,One of the very best,goes straight up to my top 10 list    every whiskylover should try this one    ,
719,Hakushu 18 Year Old,Hakushu,Not a patch on it s younger brother,"i ve had this on my purchase list for a long time and once it came back in stock i jumped on it  i m a massive fan of japanese whisky, having had pretty much every mainstream bottling on offer, and a big fan of the 12yo hakushu (probably my favourite)  i found this a little underwhelming really  it s much more complex than the 12 as you would expect and the oak is just about right but it lacks balance and the finish just isn t as good as the 12  it seems that the best parts of the 12 have been lost with the extra years and the vibrancy and dance you get from the 12 hakushu just isn t there  glad i bought one but i would chose the 12 over this in a heartbeat    which makes me a little sad inside ",
720,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,Great,awesome taste,
721,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,Top shelf drop,top shelf,
722,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,Simply Sublime,"light amber in color, nose of subtle peat and subtle white oak, flavors explodes in your mouth yet restraint in an understated elegance, soft white oak, silky and round, with spicy but long finish   tremendous power and finesse with long elegant finish   i wonder if this is the japanese oak they ve been talking about?  the taste remind me of eating best toro sushi, i e  subtle silky flavors to meditate and be inspired    this style is so different than the overtly sweet sherry oak stuff   this is sublime   96 points   this got #1 spot out of macallan 25 #2 and yamazaki 25 #3   trio of 25-year-old s compared side by side at the yamazaki distillery, for about us$ 29 per shot, (maybe less than a  shot?)",
723,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,Ã“WK,one of the best whisky that i ever tasted  beautiful stuff  ,
724,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,"Strong & Smoky, But Not As Complex As We Hoped","we tried this after the kinclaith 40 year old, and to be honest were disappointed in comparison   it was great but lacked the complexity and smooth buttery oak like richness of the kinclaith   it was good, but not amazing for us ",
725,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,John Kennedy,simply amazing,
726,Hakushu 25 Year Old ,Hakushu,maru,"send me some and i ll let you know  any one who buys one, i ll bring the steaks you supply the glasses ",
727,Hakushu Bourbon Barrel,Hakushu,IFLWhisky review,"firstly, i love japanese whisky  it just makes me feel like bill murray every time i pick one up  pathetically hoping that scarlet johansson will come along and form some weird sexual bond with me hakushu is suntory s shinobi  a silent assassin  he lurks, patiently waiting to make his move  using well practiced uzura gakure techniques (possibly learned from robert the bruce), he entices you in  using a scent that will convince you that only yourself and nature, occupy the earth  once he makes his move, his use of weaponry is textbook (possibly weapons made in kentucky)  but he daren t break the rules  the job is done with so much as a flicker of an eyelid  in a somewhat jilted manner, he performs his ritualistic engagement and then surrenders you, leaving only one laceration   the one that keeps you coming back for more  after a good execution, this shinobi hits the gut with a proud smile on his face, but always knowing he could have done better this whisky is soft on the nose, full of citrus and floral notes, morning dew, and parma violets, with a slightly peated whiff  on the palate it just floats  peachy fucking creamy  it grows and lingers with a taste of dried fruits, salty buttercream, and a dryness that is somewhat reminiscent of a japanese lager  all in all, this is a wonderful whisky  easy drinking, but it isn t going to change the world  like the girl your mother warned you about; you know you are selling yourself short, but fuck it, you re having a great timeâ€¦ until something better comes along  ",
728,Hakushu Bourbon Barrel,Hakushu,baboonish delicious,"this one is awesome  as creamy as it can get, balanced and sweet  bananas all the way, but not unpleasing  one of my favourites  ",
729,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,The Green Tea of Japanese Whisky,"fresh mint, green tea, a fresh breeze in the shade on a sunny day   that s what i get from this one  super unique  delicate  haiku in a glass   one of my favorite japanese whiskys and i ve tried most of them ",
730,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,"Subtle, balanced","hakushu is a peated japanese whiskey made from a non-peated and a heavily peated malt  the result is a whiskey with a fine balance of earthy flavors and smoke, without a heavy taste of phenols or the more iodine flavors found in islay whiskeys  despite being filtered with charcoal and bamboo filters, the spirit has very little bourbon or charcoal flavors in it  very sweet, very refined, with little acidity and a lower alcohol content than is typical of peated whiskeys  flavors of lemon, smoke, green tea, and a salinity which reminds me of soy sauces and teriyaki flavors; there s a flavor of pine or pine needles, and the taste of how autumn leaves smell  there s also something in the center of the palate that reminds me very much of suntory s blended hibiki, which uses both the hakushu and yamazaki malts - it s a sourness, and a peated flavor which is distinct in suntory s blends, and absolutely delicious  balance of sour and sweet flavors, tempered with the smoky and earthy quality  color is desirably dark without being obviously altered by caramel e150 - though to my knowledge, there is caramel coloring in this whiskey  overall, would highly recommend this malt if you re looking for a great summer whiskey to be enjoyed on the rocks or as a highball  while some of the flavor profile completely disappears with the presence of water, the smokiness and more pine flavors are retained and become prominent in the malt, making it a highly refreshing spirit for warmer days  ",
731,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,Michael   Olaf  Kappele,"very smooth, exactly what the review said, i treated as a good 12yr scotch, was not dissapointed, i work in a liquor store in ohio, i will recommend this to others, damn nice job, ",
732,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,patchma 56,i agree it s sweet-- a little smoke but i don t get any peat----- a lot of people will like this one--- i think it s closer to an irish taste then a scotch--- or for it s own merits a japanese whiskey ---a higher than 43 percenter may help it ---- i describe this as a non offensive drink that would be never need water--- because it s made smooth to please the mass--- a blend from the same distillery and almost blended into a sweet surprise your drinking alcohol drink/--,
733,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,"Sweet, smooth goodness","this is a sweet and smooth whisky with gentle, easy notes   easy sipping  no water needed  love it ",
734,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,Hate to disagree....,"this  whiskey  was far too sweet   i felt it had notes similar to sake  not a bad response, however terrible when you expect whiskey  there are fine japanese single malts out there  this one just isn t one of them ",

737,Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%,Hakushu,niiiice!,"had a bottle of this fine whisky over the xmas period and i must say it didn t last to long,it was very fresh in the mouth and so very drinkable,its the perfect drink for any medium bodyed cuban cigar   d",
738,Hakushu 10 Year Old,Hakushu,Why?,why did they stop producing this for the uk market  a really complex malt and in my view better than the 12 ,
739,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,This one is good!,"not long ago, i bought two bottles of this for about 4500 yen total (around $21 each)   i still have one and i m hanging on to it   they re over 3000 yen if you can even manage to find them now   there s really something unique about the way they marry aged malt and grain whiskies and then further age the mixture in wood   it sets this whisky apart   the closest thing i ve found to compare this to is the cutty sark prohibition   but it s not really in the same class   if you see these anywhere, i d suggest grabbing them (or telling me where they are) ",
740,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Excellent,excellent whiskey,
741,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Much better with a drop of water. ,"i enjoyed my bottle of nikka, found it a little harsh neat, but just a drop of water opened it up nicely and made it thoroughly drinkable  ",
742,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Magical (to me of course).,"it tastes like scotch but there s something different about it  after drinking it i realized it s a blend, for the grain element is married flawlessly into it  full bodied and pleasant, 51 4% but you wouldn t tell that from the nose or undiluted taste  add a bit of water and it will release some aromas that weren t there before  i admit, i approached this one with skepticism,  yeah japanese, what do they know  and i was thought a lesson: japanese can turn anything into art this one is really special, even if it s sold in 500ml bottles ",
743,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Really excellent,"excellent  incredibly full flavour, like a punch in the nose  i loved it ",
744,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,meh,this is ok and drinkable but nothing special or distinctive     they big it up far too much,
745,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Expecting too much?,"maybe i was expecting a bit too much, i ve heard so much good about this whisky  it is nicely balanced, although i hate to say i found it a little  boring  for my taste  and considering the price i ll most likely not buy it again, it may be cheap for a japanese whisky, but you could get a nice 70cl scotch for this price ",
746,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Not offensive,not offensive is the best i can say,
747,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,So much better than it should be!,"this is fantastic whisky   i live in japan   yet, it s hard to find it here much of the time   but when you do, it s actually pretty cheap ($20 or $25)   and it s worth every penny/yen   it s rich, complex, and full-flavored   sure, it does have an  edge  that older whiskies usually don t, but don t let that turn you off   it s not a bad thing   this whisky has  something special    it punches well above its weight   enjoy it if you have the chance  ",
748,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Not Scotch,"very complex range of flavours, none of which are unpleasant  reminds me of californian wines - overstating everything it tries to copy the funny shape of the bottle makes it hard to control the pouring ",
749,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,A funky little number,"despite the high percentage it doesn t try and fight you for your front teeth  there is a hint of a bite but it s soft, like a gentle nibble  it s rather smooth and even a little creamy on the palette  definitely a recommended purchase  ",
750,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Okay,"not much in the way of flavour, it s definitely drinkable but nothing to shout about  not my taste i m afraid ",
751,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,The little superstar,"great whisky  notes of fruits, spices, and toffee  51 abv but goes down as it s 40 abv  stacks up well against yamazaki, hibiki, hakushu, etc at a fraction of the cost  only available in 2 stores in the us ",
752,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Worthy to be in any collection ,nectar in a glass with a very little highland water it is equal to the very best scotch ,
753,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,really good and nice on the palate,i normally have jamesons red breast  would you put a little water with the nikka,
754,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"A whisky thats worth for the collection.. the nikka black, to taste.next! This one, very impressive. Cheers","its got an inviting nose to it  , hints of spice, subtle oak amidst flowery tones,  good one to sip on in any weather       pretty down pat; like your master tasters described it perfect for melbourne  aus got introduced to it at a cool bar called sloth  thanks  boris lissanevitch jr ",

756,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Bloody good whisky!,seriously good  iâ€™ve tasted a few japanese whiskies in my time but this one is just so good  its really intense flavour of sweet caramel & far eastern delight delivers something so very pleasurable  the barrels they use impart a flavour i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve found elsewhere  if my translation app works well enough it talks about a soy or sake effect  whatever it is itâ€™s bloody good & really value even if itâ€™s only 50 cl  do yourself a favour & try this  your mouth will thank you ;-),
757,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Good japanese blend,"a tasty blend from nikka but a bit expensive as it is only 500ml  nikka crafted a unique taste of vanilla, japanese plums and dried fruits  abv is 53% so adding some water will take away the edge  otherwise a top quality drink from yoichi, hokkaido ",
758,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,JoeT,for my review see highland poacher blended ,
759,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Can t believe what good value this is.,"very appealing nose of marzipan, vanilla, banana, pineapple, cedar, pecans and cinnamon   high esters - maybe from long ferment?  more like a rum nose - but whisky like when water added with honey, slight peat and malt evident   really pronounced on the palate - baked orange and pineapple, josticks, prunes, hay, sandalwood, tobacco, cedar - evolves   long, complex finish - phenolics, coffee, all sorts really   balanced, intense, defined, long and complex   outstanding value ",
760,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Platinum taste,best whisky which stands alone in its own class of sophistication and taste,
761,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Banzai ,a truly exceptional whisky  may the japanese reign over the whisky industry indefinitely  ,

765,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Bang for buck,"not a dram to rival the true greats but a very pleasant sipping whisky and in terms of quality for cost it s, pound for pound, the best value foreign whisky on the market a must have for any decent drinks cabinet ",
766,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Exelent,my favourite blend so far  fairly spicy and very interesting taste  this is in no way a boring whisky ,
767,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,try this one,"i have tried one bottle just by chance when i was in yokouska  in 2016 without doing any research on the product and i was pleasantly surprised  i would recommend to any serious whiskey consumer to try this one, you wont be disappointed   ",
768,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Umami!,"has everything one would want in a proper whisky; it s sweet, salty, fruity, bitter, and little smokey  the balance between these flavours is absolutely superb  it hits not just the tip or the side of your tongue, it attacks the whole damned muscle  it s a hell of a dram and there s only one word that can define properly: umami  ",
769,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Simple.. delicious... whisky ,"so, i ve been a whisky drinker for years, and it s easy to get caught up between scotch and a bourbon flavoured liquor  there s a clear difference between nikka and other whiskys, maybe its the price point, it is a very high quality drop  the flavours are smooth, warm caramel with a rose scent, delivers a smooth, vanilla palet that takes you a journey from first sip to the last  i ve mixed nikka with cola, stired between sips with a spoon   for some strange reason beyond my expertise the drink turns to a light brown colour which is in between cola and whisky more towards the bottom end of the glass  i mix the single barrel nikka with ice cubes as with all my whiskys and the journey is worth telling my story ",
770,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,gentle power,"my favourite blended,  a smooth all rounder, with punch and character  ",
771,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Like being smacked in the face.,"from the outset, you can smell it s slightly stronger than usual  it s a proper punch of flavour  slightly unrefined but still plenty to offer  it s spicy in the mouth and certainly not like a smooth malt  the finish lasts into the middle of next week  this is my first japanese whisky and i will certainly buy more  it s a fun drink to be enjoyed with friends   not a quiet contemplator  ",
772,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Quality is fading,sadly this is not as good as it was 2 years ago  the whiskey tastes very very young  this used to be my favorite go-to whiskey  i hope my bottle mellows in the coming months as it oxidizes   ,
773,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Terrific value in such a small bottle.,sitting in a ryokan in shibu onsen it tastes pretty good to me i bought this on impulse in nagano on our way here and first sip confirms what great value this drop is for an unaged bottling it really does have a character you d associate with much more expensive japanese whisky and i ll be bringing more of this home with me if i can find it again  ,
774,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"looong finish, satisfying blend, take your time with this one","color: goldennose: 	sweet, honey, apples, melon, liquorice, mint, chocolatepalate: 	after brushing teeth: dry/sweet entry, light, hints of fruity aroma, liquorice, spicy, lemonfinish: 	slightly bitter, sweet, long and warmalthough 500ml bottle is a little small, 51% makes up for some of it  good whisky neat without any water added, flavors are complex, lots of oak and fruit, honey  very spicy even after having it sits for 30min  great whisky to sip on with a long finish, can savor of the flavor long after swallowing  ",
775,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,I would recommend this over highland park 18 if cost is an issue. HP 18 has a better flavour profile but only marginally. Nikka s higher ABV wins me over.,excellent value for money   a truly exceptional scotch that rivals highland park 18  higher abv with a very pleasant flavour profile  ,
776,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,splendido,"this is about as good as affordable blends get, but the real star of the nikka line-up is, alas, not on your site their yoichi single malt 500ml, which i filled up my suitcase with on the way back from japan last year is spectacularly good - drinkable everyday without ever getting tired of it     and for around aud65 thanks to low taxes, it s truly sinful ",
777,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Like a Cognac/Scotch Crossover,"i tried it at a house party and went to buy two 500ml bottles of it  it is a like cognac crossing over a *very fruity speyside  stewed apple/pear with a hint of orange in a syrup; some floral, spices, vanilla/bubble gum on the side   overall, for $51 cad it is value-for-money, solid, and great if you want a speyside but more fruity and *decisively differnt*  ",
778,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,awesomeness in a bottle,"everything you need and want to know about whisky is locked in this cute bottle  if one person is permitted a bottle of whisky only, there is no other i will want     nikka pure malt (white) is equally good    ",
779,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Smooth Wonderfulness,"after falling in love with nikka  the one  i thought i would give this a go and it is superb  smooth, syrup like with a wonderful sweet toffee like finish  superb ",
780,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Very Impressed,"my first japanese whisky and it sure did not disappoint   great nose, palate and finish   only  wish we could get a larger bottle in the states ",
781,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,No better ,"i ve sampled a lot of malts over time but nikka from the barrel surpasses the lot thick, bold, aromatic    this has it all  ditch any illusion you may have that whisky must come from the glen     this is something to behold  i know i m gushing but this really is that good  ",
782,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,And breathe,"had some at an english distillery sampling, had a variety of the english which were from ok to yuk to yummy, then was given nikka as an experiment  citricous and wafts of flavour if allowed to sit a while  bought some english and a bottle of this  blooming loved it with water and neat,, perhaps preferred with a thimble of water more  but definitely worth a purchase  ",
783,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Auguri,best wishes ,
784,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Hard to keep a bottle for long,"liked it since the first time i tried it, and for that price not much can beat it  yet again time to get another bottle  ",
785,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Give it some time, give it some water","first expression of this whisky for me was horrible, i was thinking that something must had gone wrong    and something did, the way i drank it this beverage requires some time, be very cautions with water as you can overdrown this easily while trying to down its alcohol content  give it a spoon of water & wait, and after 10 minutes, try it out slowly, let your nose and mouth to get accustomed to alcohol, and you would discover its rich taste very interesting experience, but unfortunately has a japan whisky price, which are a little bit overpriced ",
786,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Great!  And difficult to  peg  into a category,"i first tasted this at the whisky show at old billingsgate in 2016   was  spot on  with nose, flavor, and aftertaste   bought one bottle, and drank it so fast, i missed the nuances   ordered two more, and will give you a more thorough review in two weeks   overall, an enormously strong, complex, and flavorful whisky, with plenty of fruitiness, and totally irresistible  ",
787,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,What a whisky!!,"buy this whisky, its incredible value for money  im a total novice in whisky, but here are my notes   i nã¦sen: syrlige frugter, apelsin skrald og frugtsalatmunden: frugt, oak, mandel og et hint af karamel  nose: elegant fruits like in a fruit salat, leaning more towards citrus fruits/orange peel  slightly sweet and also nutty, almonds  mouth: fruits follow through, then come almonds/nuts and a hint of caramel  at the end a little dry and rather oaky   ",
788,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Very Good,"my 2nd japanese, after hibiki 12, and i m very impressed, again  agree with poster below - this is thick    wonderfully so   lots of tropical fruit, spice and almost buttery on the palate   lovely mouth-feel and a long sweet syrupy finish with a touch of wood spice dryness     i like a few drops of water in this but it can be drunk without no problem   considering rising prices this is an excellent value whisky from japan    recommended ",
789,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Delicious and surprising,"it tastes almost  thick  - wonderful and unexpected  not at all like a scotch, but even more different than any bourbon  enormous character ",
790,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Stunning,not much more to say really but you have to try this what a whisky and a real good price,
791,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Where else would it come from?,"if you have not tried it,just buy some ",
792,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,facebook.com/maltmondays - my online whisky blog,"@maltmondaysthe nose  is predictably strong, a hard hit of alcohol, however once your nose adjusts the complexity does cut through, intense hits of brown sugar, rum & raisins  fruit plays a big part in the nature of this whisky  the nose has a great mix of spice and fruit, think a whole orange poked with star anise before placing in your winter mulled wine pot    the taste  has all the traits the nose implies, caramelized cooked fruits, toffee, sticky, buttery-ness on the tongue  that welcome spice hits back too, itâ€™s a 5-spice and asian cuisine style heat  this is a big mouthful, donâ€™t be intimidated by the strength, let it linger until you get that beautiful mouthful of christmas pudding and warm winter desserts    the finish  thankfully this does the taste justice, long, smooth and very warming  thereâ€™s some oak maturity too which is a nice contrast to the fruit  ginger and cinnamon hints arise after a few seconds and they are very welcome   the rich spice stays long after youâ€™ve had a few drams and walked away from this drop  something i found hard to do    ",
793,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Full body,"full body, spicy finish",
794,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Wow!,"wish i knew about this before  my first whisky from japan, and wow   what a surprise, had it in a sushi bar after dessert now, i am not that much of an expert in these matters, but this is one of those drams that could easily be mistaken for a malt and given that appropriate score  try it out  well worth it ",
795,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Oak!,slight oak? really? this smells strong oak  almost like a mix between a bourbon and rum ,
796,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Wow, I was not expecting this","first tried nikka last year, the first taste was a pleasant surprise  i have never been able to describe the taste of whisky in the way many experts have done, however flowers and many other fragrance s are evident together with a slight oak  it s one to savour  ",
797,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,You should try it.,"this really is amazing stuff  i ve paid three times the price for whisky that wasn t this good  if all whisky was free, i f give it a 9/10, but since price is a factor for most of us, i ll give it a 10/10  you can t go wrong with this one  once again the mom tasting notes are dead on  i will buy more when this bottle is gone  ",

800,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Nikka!!!,"the bottle   oh the bottle     expect to loose a few drops as the bottle is not designed for an easy pour  now, the taste; first sniff, seemed a little intense, factor in it s a high %% drop and it s expected  definitely under tones of vanilla and citrus, i found it a little harsh, but i m coming from 21yr royal salute - which is very smooth  i m taking one the gents previous post advise and let it breath for 20    no doubt i ll be raving afterwards ðÿ˜‰ðÿ‘",
801,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,A good strong cask strength.,a very delicate whisky; some caramel and honey overtones  i don t seem to love it as much as others but it s still enjoyable  good price point too and excellent stand out packaging ,

809,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Just grrat,briljant taste,
810,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Remarkably good,given the price that this retails at this is fantastic and would hold its own against most  loved it  smooth  lots of caramel and toffee flavours  ,
811,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,First time Japanese and really Impressed ,"this was the only decent japanese whiskey with a decent price in my location  so tried this  i am glad i did buy this one  it s one of a kind  initial notes of caramel, toffee and at the back the alcohol and smoke hits you in a good way  it s something unique that i have not tasted in any other whiskey  needs teaspoon of water to open it up and be a little bit more mellow the bottle although looks nice is a pain to pour the whiskey  you lose some drops trying to pour to a glass  too bad considering this is a small bottle and i don t like to waste a single drop  ",
812,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Virginal experience,"tried this whisky for the first time tonight and what a triumph    caramel, yes, and smoothness in great measure  i hadn t tried japanese whisky before but consider me hooked   i m almost tempted to go downstairs for another sipped shot but might have to plump for sleep   well done, tokyo ",

814,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Fantastic,fantastic,
815,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Great!!,"having been a single malt drink for a while now, i recently spotted this and felt the urge to try it, the description is perfect its very sweet and has a long warming after that lasts and is a delight, i am very impressed with this blended dram from the far east, i have only had 2 small drinks but i am very impressed,  the package is nice and the bottling is pretty cool would recommend ",
816,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Why Not!! Nikka Whiskey,let it rest and then enjoy   this whiskey kicks many more expensive bottles out of the park    if you haven t tried it yet then my question to you is simple    why not    ,
817,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Opening it up,"for me, this is one of the very best blended whisky ever produced  over the years blended whiskies have improved so much and this is a fine example of that  it s a complex whisky that opens up beautifully with around 15ml of water (or 1 small ice cube) for the 50ml double - it also helps because of the alcohol content  it really is like opening a hidden box of flavours within the drink  really do love this whisky, very delicious  it s a 4 out 5 simply because in the grand scheme of things it can never quite make it to the summit, it s stuck at base camp 4    very commendable just not quite the real mccoy  ",
818,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Horrible,i didn t like it  nothing against a whisky from scotland or ireland   ,
819,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Dtac_se,wonderful dram  ,
820,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Nikka,dont need to say something about this one  ,
821,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,I love this!,thank you  ,
822,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Outstanding, sweet, complex, smooth, amazing","i was absolutely shocked by this one  initially i got a burbon-esque nose off it, very sweet, slightly oily  in the mouth its fantastically fruity with a hint of malt, and a good kick of alchol but without killing off any of the flavour  sweet apple, toffee, some red berries and a little biscuit malt are the dominant flavours, along with subtle vanilla and a hint of citrus vanilla and chocolate comes through in the finish along with the berries  its almost like a delicious juicy chocolate and berry cake  i cannot wait to get a bottle of this for myself, but i m also nervous that it wont even last one sitting  ",
823,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Abaot the  nikka from the barrel  ,"it was my first encounter with any whiskies from japan  pleasant surprise  i have to confess i am a believer with the isley, but i found this good   g rã³na",
824,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Not bad,"am no expert  for me, whisky is either nice or disgusting  this falls into the former  it doesn t make me screw my face up as it s smooth on the palate and it s a warm and comforting drink  nice ",
825,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Pleasantly surprised!,was given a sample of whiskey during a shopping trip and fell in love immediately  bought a nikka whiskey from the barrel and one of the pure malt  just opened the whiskey from the barrel and love it  so much more complex than i expected  is it time for another yet?:),
826,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Astonishing depth for a blend,"picked it up at the duty free yesterday and having the first drink  first up, the bottle is brilliant even though it s only  5l, it reminds me of moonshine jars when you open the bottle, the alcohol overpowers the nose, so you ve got to let it breathe add a few drops of water to the glass, let it swirl for a few minutes before the first sip  the nose then feels a lot like a good bourbon  the first sip is smoky, even herbal, almost like an islay  bourbon and vanilla in the background, but traces, only traces  whisky for the darkest winter night  the finish is decently long, astringent, almost like pine and menthol  touch of woodyness  that was 15 minutes ago  now it seems to have smoothed with the flavor profile reversed  bourbon, toffee, vanila, a touch of fruits (not as much as a speyside) to the fore, the smokyness comes through in the background  the finish is clovery this is one of those whiskys that will give you a different experience as you work your way down the bottle  absolute gem, brilliant structure and depth for a high abv, and to think its a blend  scotch blends can eat their hearts out - black dog and jonny walkers ain t got nothing on this one  as good as a top single malt  one word - brilliant ",
827,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Great Value and Flavors,during these dark times of high prices and low availability of japanese whiskies in general this is a great bang for the buck  offers some strong intense flavors that can be enjoyed neat but can be further opened up and savored with the addition of time and bit of water  ,

832,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Amazing Whisky,"while this whisky isn t cheap, it makes up for it with a wonderful deep flavour  very little burn too, given the abv  fantastic stuff ",
833,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Simpy amazing...,this time i bought two bottles :) ,
834,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Pour, sniff, allow to breathe. Sniff, drink, enjoy, repeat.","this is my first venture into japanese juice so i did not know what to expect  as a matter of fact, i wasn t even after japanese  i was after an aberlour a bunadh 60 caliber but my go-to danish/german bordershop was out (same shop where i got the balvenie 16y peated cask  yum yum) it s a 51 4 caliber blend as most might already know from the bottle into the glencairne: quite a bit alcohol in the nose, which is no surprice due the the number printet at the bottle  so it has to rest for while  then nice stuff rise from the glass  i get cinnamon and plums and orange  christmas is in my nose  as the initial alcohol wears off, a pleasant sweetness adds to the nose  my first thought was candyfloss so now i get that every time  smoke is completely absent sipping it, the surprise does start: i d expect quite a tickling on the lips and tongue from the high percentage, but it s gentle and caressing and doesn t burn at all  it s fruit on the palate along with a more peppery spiciness  a very fullbodied taste that completely fills my mouth and intensivates when exhaling through the sniffing device  finish: very sweet yet warming but quite short (i know that some says it s long but not i)  which is fine, because then you just pour once again and start from the beginning  only downside: it s just 50 cl  so you ll be out of ammo in no time  thank god, they make so much of the that they are selling it   ",
835,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Fantastic!!!,"as all japanese whiskies, this is just great and i just love the bottle ",
836,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,"i must admit is a really good whisky and good value for money,and i was never disappointed  with it yet to poor man s aberlour a bunadh you can t compare it to a bunadh  because it s a totally different stuff   it s like to compering a dick to  a door handle ",
837,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Extraordinary and fabulous!!!,"for me this is same quality level with yamazaki 18yo but much more affordable price, great value  ",
838,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Burn, From the Barrel","got a sample to try, and from a neat pour the nose at first was overpowered with the alcohol, so any notes were confused at first  but eventually vanilla bean, custard, and a faint hint of spice and musty, wet oak came thru  the sweet toffeed palate has a healthy burn  and the finish is perfectly long and oaky, but still a little hot with a touch of grassiness at the end very japanese and very enjoyable in its own right  but this dram doesn t hold the heat from the 51 4% well  ",
839,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Incredibly clean with a nice gentle burn.,"tried this in a bar once, was my first japanese whisky  one of my all time favorites now, goes down like water but has a nice gentle burn after  some great tastes  ",
840,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Still one of my favorites,"i was fortunate to get a dram of this in an asian whiskey tasting   for me, the nikka stood out above the others, i had to get myself a bottle   about 1/3 of a way through the bottle, and it s still one of my absolute favorites ",
841,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,I yield!,after all these years of looking down on blends i finally and gladly raise the white flag to this little stunner  i am disarmed and i willingly surrender    marvelous ,
842,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Possibly the most underrated Whisky.,"i have no doubt that in a blind taste test with much pricier, prestigious whiskies, this unassuming little bottle would more than hold it s own  this would surly get a few discerning nods on the nose alone  aroma science could be learnt from this dram alone it s that complex, but pleasurable too  once you sip this stuff you can you can expect rapture  if you hadn t already guessed this would definitely be my whisky of choice  it somehow manages to combine all the best attributes of bourbon and scotch  there s not much smoke going on here but everything else is covered, and done with sublime execution  all the things i look for in a good whisky are here  vanilla first, followed by rich marmalade and dried fruit, followed by the best spice that doesn t have any peppery burn just luscious fruitcake spices  the finish remains fruity but now it is rich caramelised orange and chocolate for good measure  this is a true gourmand whisky  i m not sure where nikka are sourcing their barrels from but they are possibly the best barrels around  the japanese sure know how to make whisky  if you like whisky, get this glorious liquid perfection  ",
843,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,One of a kind,"by far the most memorable japanese whisky i ve tried  if you re a bourbon fan like me, you ll love it   rich, flavoursome, delicious and unbelievably good value ",
844,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Caramelised banana,"is the first thing i discern from my bottle i bought some years ago on edinburgh s royal mile  the alcohol burn slowly creeps up on you but never gets particularly harsh  a definite grassy aftertaste, with something milder than peat (muddy puddle?) around the edges  ",
845,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Japanese Wonder,well this whisky knows how to make an impact  just a quick sniff will tell you this is a whisky which will pack a punch  notes of oak and spice and a little smoke come through  at first sip you ll notice the impact of the 51% abv without it being too overwhelming which is impressive  a big taste of oak and even a little malt come through with some warming pepper which continues onto the finish with a little smokey hints  it s yet another example of why japanese whiskies should be tried and taken seriously as a quality drink ,
846,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Yabba dabba doo!,"sometimes whiskies just come and slap you in the face and tell you that all of your previous beliefs about things  this is a big hit of ripe rich fruitcake and toasted almonds  cinnamon and nutmeg notes add to the complexity  it s huge on flavour and that body and intensity along with the quality of spirit hide that 51% alcohol which seems to be smooth and soft in texture  it s japanese, and it s a blend and it s totally awesome  ",
847,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Excellent,"this is a complex and demanding whisky  the nose entices with clove, lemon, satsuma, and honey  the palate mixes ginger, oak, vanilla, toffee, and blackcurrant  the finish is very long, with clove, black pepper, and fruity sweetness  the character of this whisky changes significantly with a little air, too  it softens and sweetens  nikka is a new favourite  ",
848,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,A Japanese Delight,"nose: treacle toffee, icing sugar, golden syrup, orange zest, dried fruit, apricot, a hint of smoke, buttermilk, some black tea and coffee palate: toffee, vanilla, honey, cocoa, mixed fruit preserves, jam tarts, some cinnamon, orange fruit juice and some creamy notes finish: a long and initially sweet finish with notes of almond, oak, some pepper spice and crisp fruit which turns increasingly dry into the close ",
849,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Impressive,"four of us compared this creation to the first half of the premium whisky calendar, so far it s got second place i also like the shape of the compact bottle ",
850,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,A blocky little samurai bottling full of japanese spirit,"i bought this for a song in tokyo, but it s worth searching out at the slightly higher price it s sold for abroad (mom s pricing is pretty good, imo)  a high abv blend that showcases good, inexpensive japanese whisky  i d also suggest that the idiosyncratic, miminalist bottling means this works well as a gift option ",
851,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Unreal ,"so well made that you would think you are drinking a 40 percent whisky  smooth, powerful and delicious  should be ten times the price  amazing ",

866,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Would be a 10,amazing dram  would be a perfect ten if it were 70cl  ,
867,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Very impressed,wow   firstly can i say what amazing service master of malt gives   i ordered  my bottle on a monday eve and it was delivered tues when delivery was advised  by fri so very impressed   it was packaged well so no chance of damage and the whiskey is presented in a chic black box which made me think what an excellent gift this would be for someone as the price is on point  however this time the gift was for me  having worked in japan i understand their love of whisky which  is also where i picked up my taste for it  i hadn t tried this brand before but have to say i will def be purchasing again  smooth but with a hitch of heat that leaves a delightful sensation as well as flavour  this yes please for me and will be recommending this website to everyone i know        ,
868,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Day 3 of the Whisky Advent Calendar: My first ever Japanese,"i ve never tried japanese whisky before and until recently was oblivious to the fact that they re a renowned whisky producing nation  absolutely the best blended whisky i ve ever experienced  i don t see how this can be compared with a smoky, pungent talisker  such a lovely, spicy and woody aroma - i ve kept a small drop in my glencairn just to keep coming back to it without the alcohol hit ",
869,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,wasn t expecting a big bite,"i m a bourbon lover, enjoy scotch, and also enjoy white dog  i found this to have a bit more heat than expected i also bought a bottle of super and hope it is a bit smoother ",
870,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,slightly changed since my last review,"interesting  my previous bottle (2012) was distinctly sugared almonds  this time (2013) the packaging has changed & its generally drier with more attack - i suspect less aging which is a shame  nose is remarkable - goes on and on  on the palate however that fierce attack is too much, a minty mouth numbing sensation, perhaps peat but no smoke  aftertaste is somewhat killed by the burning sensation ",
871,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,forgot to rate it!,forgot the 10 stars it deserves  ,
872,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Really Loved It! ,"what can i say, i am not an expert of whiskey by any stretch of the imagination (although i have drunk all sorts) but it clearly came across this was really good i would highly recommend you try this beauty      ",
873,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,To try!,a basic japanese whisky with an amazing rapport quality/price       highly recommended especially for novices who want to discover the japanese whiskey ,
874,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,And here is my rating (missing from above..doh!),"only losing points for not being as focused as my preferred single malts, and having a distinct kentucky feel to it  how they likened it to talisker and not makers mark is a poor reflection on the shop staff  that not withstanding, i would never have considered trying it without their shnaffoo, so can t really grumble  fallen on a diamond in the ruff  ",
875,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,All of the above...and then some!,"fairly new to the drink myself and currently working through the classic malts  i found this on quest for oban (which is going to have to wait)and bought it as the store keeper picked up on my love of talisker and said i d like this  it is nothing like talisker but, i do love this   i rarely take my drink neat but this is different  i was snobbish about blends, but again, this is different  its nose is rich and pungent but very bourbon like  i was immediately reminded of makers mark dipped cigars  but on the tongue it has so many flavors, the one that stands out is licorice root  where does that come from?? i could sniff this all day but i am afraid it might be addictive  i ve just started on my whiskey shelf at home and this is going to be a show stopper  can t wait to share it with loved ones  ",

878,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,I wrote just getting familiar above,"and now i know for sure why many rave about this   it really is fantastic   last night i was taking those prefect hummingbird sized drop-sips, and i really experienced the texture and amazing flavor of this whisky   i have yet to try with a drop of water, but i don t know how soon i will, because it is fantastic neat, and a prefect slow sipper   again, maybe bc of strength, but i find the buzz from this unique and very desirable   now i m trying to figure out how i might b able to get more than the 4 i already have into my suitcase along with: yoichi and miyagikyo no age statements, nikka 12 year pure malt, yamazaki 10 yr single malt, yoichi 10 , and miyagikyo 10 ",

880,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Just getting familiar,"scared at first when i nosed one of the bottles i bought here in japan, because it is strronng  but now when i open the bottle for a sniff, wow, very much bourbon like sweetness, can t wait to experiment with small drops of water with small servings of this whisky to see what that does  but i generally like to drink neat, and so i do here  the nose can be so wonderful and i detect lovely favors on the tongue with a fiery sensation on the way down   but at over 50% that is to be expected  all i know so far is that i like this whisky more and more with each try   and the buzz is very very nice  does anyone from m o m  or anywhere else know if it is true that this and other tasty whiskies really have color added? i don t even know if that has a bad connotation to it; and even tho the majority of reviews online have people saying they love this whisky (and many say it is one of the best bargain quality whiskies in the world), one guy didn t have nice things to say and added that this was another dram with color added 	 anyone privy?",

883,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Absolutely Delicious ,"i am far from a whiskey connoisseur but i have to write this review, i had my first taste of whisky in the form of johnnie walker about 6 months ago, from that moment i knew i had found my goto alcohol to unwind and relax with  since that moment 6 months ago i have tried glenlivet, glenfiddich, famous grouse, talisker and jamesons  i thought i had whisky pegged, but i just got this today and i can honestly say its the best whiskey ive tasted so far, it hits your mouth like johnnie walker but the taste a few seconds after is amazing, it almost turns into a liquor taste as the flavour becomes very creamy, but still packs the amazing feeling drinking whisky gives  like i said i m no where near an expert on this stuff, but to topple all those other brands ive tasted, this whisky is something special ",
884,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,"Wonderful. Bourbon influence, remarkable value ","incredible value for an exceptional whiskey  matured in bourbon hogsheads i imagine because it s heading in that direction - not a  scotch  wannabe in any way  despite strength (50%?) its smooth and rounded enough to drink neat  aftertaste goes on forever, some peat, rich mouthfeel, complex nose with orange peel/ almonds/ coconut/ peat and plenty more shame it s only 50cl packageing is quite special - a great present  scotch connoiseurs might not enjoy because it isnt an immitator  but if you have an open mind, this will be a firm favourite and worth tracking down ",
885,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Beautiful,it s really beautiful whisky    but only what i want to know is how many years is matured ? or this information is unknown ? can somebody help me with it ? ,
886,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,Amazing whisky,"i just tried this last night thanks to a friend having a bottle this is an exquisite whisky amazing nose, i could sit sniffing it in for hours  very good and rich palate  i must get one for myself soon  ",
887,Nikka Whisky From The Barrel,Nikka,A good birthday present,this whiskey was bought for me as a present and i found it to be very pleasant but stronger than my usual scotch  it was better than i expected; i wouldn t have had the japanese down as accomplished whiskey makers  i would buy it again and would recommend it ,

890,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Wow,"a truly unique whisky  you ll think  coffey  is a misspelling, because it kind of tastes like a frappuccino  i know that may not be the most educated way of describing a whiskey, but seriously, that s what it tastes like know anyone who says they don t like whisky? drop an ice cube into a finger or two of this and watch their eyes open  this is the smoothest whisky i ve ever had in my life  and 90 proof with no heat   how did they do it?",

894,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Excellent. ,ignore the previous review  as a scotsman with a large selection of malts in my cabinet i can honestly say this is the nicest whisky i have ever had  ,
895,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Rip-off,it tastes about the same like american grain whiskey  only costs twice as much ,
896,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,One to keep on hand ,"deep and rich nose packed with stone fruits, berries, caramel, and vanilla  definitely sweet but a presence of grass and soil is noticeable  the taste is delicate, refined, and complex, but the real star of this whisky is the finish   expect a flavor bomb of vanilla and oak that lasts and lasts like it was shot out of a cannon  it just keeps going  a real hidden gem of a whisky  ",
897,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,A sure thing - very tasty.,"very nice, mellow whisky   definitely toward a bourbon with hints of vanilla and caramel   it s a great one to introduce to whisky novices   i m not sure how it compares to  nikka from the barrel - alas they don t ship that one to the states     ",
898,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Overall great,"smells hard core, goes in full of flavor, goes down smooth, aside from the hard liquor small, overall great ",
899,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Caramelized sugars & butter on toast,"smell like a brandy, spicy, white grape, apple, brown sugar, burnt sugar, caramel, hints of maple syrup, buttery, decadent, sugar sweet, cologne, toasted wheat bread   to me this whiskey amounts to sweet caramelized sugars and butter smeared on some toasted wheat bread  very tasty, my only complaints are the price ($59 99 700ml) and nas ",
900,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Cambridge Whisky Nut says:,one of the most unusual and intriguing whiskies out there    but oh so good   it was a favorite at a recent tasting i hosted  beginners and connoisseurs alike loved the harmony of the smells and flavours of this  the tasting notes from the chaps on this site are spot on to give you a good idea  fantastic buy  ,
901,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Impressive,"the japanese whiskies i had tasted never satisfied me (i e  hibiki 18, miyagikyo 10)  but i was really impressed by this one  it s a bit like the king car conductor but less overpowering sweetness, bourbon influences but more herbal and with a fino-feeling/taste to it  i usually drink sherrybombs but this one may become a standard bottle in my collection ",
902,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Like a very good bourbon,"i bought a sample of this after trying compass box hedonism and being impressed, as i d never tried grain whisky before  it s nothing like hedonism, but is very delicious, like a fine bourbon with hints of vanilla and toffee  i prefer this to nikka from the barrel, which is also very good, but this seems much smoother  highly recommended ",
903,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Really enjoyed it...,"had this at a small bar in san francisco last business trip  really enjoyed it  i m new to whisk(e)y and previously enjoyed bourbons much more  this reminds me of a nice mellow, very smooth bourbon  i drink mine with a nice whisky ice cube that slowly melts and as it adds a little water to the whisky, it really opens up  definitely one of my smoother drinking japanese whisky experiences  price is also quite reasonable with good availability for a japanese whisky ",
904,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Surprisingly good,"i tasted this one this christmas and i love it  it did three things to me, the same things that a good single malt, a 20 year old port and a smooth cognac do, but all at once     dark, light and then thick with a memory sweet, all rolled into one?mind you i usually drink the highland stuff and peated to the core, this isn t that, but this is rather good ",
905,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Bourbon,"i think it s up there with some of the better bourbons   that said, good bourbon can be had for $40 at cask strength, so the price is pretty high   is there some rye or something else in here?  maybe, not sure; it s been a while since i ve had a bourbon to compare against   still, an interesting novelty ",

907,Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky,Nikka,Coffey Grain *and* Coffey Malt,more cousins than sisters - both the coffey grain and the coffey malt are wonderful  the real opportunity for an aficionado is to have both bottles  you can have a great celebration simply tasting both in the same evening  i always bring both bottles to the table when we have company   ,

910,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Smooth.,"i paid a little more than most for my bottle simply because i live in an expensive area just outside of washington dc  as a first time buyer when i first cracked it open i gave it a whiff and it had a lovely aroma of fruits and smoke  i then anticipatingly pour a shot into my favorite glass, and as i always do, i gulped it down in one swift motion letting it slide down my tongue and the back of my throat  it went down ultra-smooth leaving an after aroma in my nose that was both gentle and enjoyable  sort of like taking a cup of warm coffee and slurping it down  i will buy this again however i will try and find a cheaper location  a bit too pricey at $71 a bottle  i ve seen it for $10 less online  i can only hope that i can find it that cheap locally in the store  all in all for any liquor under $100 a bottle this stuff definitely hits the spot  if you want to sit down and have a few stiff shots but don t like your throat to burn like somebody poured lit lighter fluid down your throat, this is the whiskey for you  two words: very smooth   ",
911,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,So delicately balanced,"wow, big green apple on nose  drink straight: scotchy for sure with japanese balance made light & smooth  sweet & bitter grass with the lightest of smoke for me  finishes like wine imo  ",
912,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Worth a try!,costco had a few bottles so i picked one up  very enjoyable blend  after my first sip i wasn t sold but after letting it get some air it really grew on me  very easy to drink and carries an excellent range of flavors  for $50 i was very happy with the purchase   ,
913,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,"A very approachable and easy drinking, smooth whiskey with just enough character","pay no attention to the negative comments that some have left  this is japanese whiskey (jw), not scotch  yes, similar but not scotch  i think most negative reviewers had some preconceived expectation that was not met  i tried this without knowing what to expect--i think it was better that way   anyway, give this a try if you are getting into jw  you won t be disappointed at all   i m very glad i chose this one   when i first opened it, it had slight smokiness which faded after getting some oxygen  it has a pleasantly smooth character with just enough flavor and complexity to make it enjoyable  this will be a staple in the spirits cabinet for years to come  i ve also let several different whiskey drinkers (including 2 very seasoned bourbon guys) try this, and they all agreed it was very good and worth trying   i m looking forward to trying the other nikka offerings sooner than later    ",
914,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,The Go-To Underestimated Japanese Whiskey,"exceptionally smooth  one of the smoothest whiskeys i ve had  i had seen a special on japanese whiskey s recently and felt the urge to pick one out  did a little reading, but feel lucky to have chosen the nikka taketsuru  a few reviewers below have beaten this up for lack of smokiness  wrong scotch for that  or too heavy? did not feel that  this is an easy well---balanced scotch to have if you keep 2-3 on the shelf  ",
915,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,A great morning whisky. ,"an exceptional blend, very drinkable and affordable  the nose is bees wax, raisins with a light vanilla charcoal smoke in the back  opens with warm spiced citrus and a short smokey pepper finish ",
916,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Great Japanese whiskey,"very nice japanese whiskey, enough complexity but still pretty smooth",
917,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,"Taste is not good, heavy, not smoo","its not smooth, not nice, but heavy taste  even with ice cubes  i will not recommend  ",
918,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Doesn t stand out,"i looked forward to trying this from some of the reviews i d read, but ultimately thought it neither stood out nor offered anything unique when compared with a variety of other whiskeys at a similar price point  flavor was fine, but underdeveloped  simply put, it s unmemorable  at the current $60 price point, there are a number of far more enjoyable options to buy ",
919,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Very nice entry in to Japanese Nikka ,"very nice pepper, but sweet beautiful colour ",
920,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Great Japanese whiskey,this is a great whiskey  it is well put together and the flavors are complex  ,
921,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,I highly recommend it. ,"a very nice whisky, a classic example of japanese craftsmanship  the scottish origins are evident, and is capable of standing alongside many a scotch  this has a touch of smoke, is sweet with a bit o fruit, vanilla and a touch of nuts  this is well balanced and i will keep it in my cabinet as part of my collection  makes for a nice, reasonably priced daily drinker  i doubt i will ever tire of it  ",
922,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Nice,"although not an expert, i find this whisky one of the best tasting experiences i ever had  true to the above description 100%  i would definitely suggest it ",
923,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,JW Black,"this is just jw black, at double the price   i can t say i ve tasted them side-by-side, but i ve had jw black and jw blue     and this is no jw blue   (and even jw blue was just okay)   i haven t tried any of the other jw expressions, but seriously there s no need to   this thing is right at the black level, just double the price ",
924,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Good for its value ,seems pretty close to a yamazaki 12 to me although more fruit on the palate  not bad but i agree drinking too much could lead to some heart burn  a whiskey to enjoy 1 glass per session ,
925,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,How is this so well reviewed?,"this was really rough   i decided to buy a bottle and line it up against previous age statements in a blind tasting    well it wasn t blind for long   immediately on the nose you could tell this had spirits under 3 years old in the glass my biggest gripe here is it tastes nothing like the previous taketsuru bottlings   there is no smokiness and it reminds me more of an american rye than something that belongs along side quality scotch    the aged is extremely balanced and one of my all time favorites, the nas leaves me feeling i spent way too much    for young inexperienced whisky  there s nothing wrong with young american rye (not my favorite, but there s nothing wrong with it), but they should bottle this spirit under a different name    normally, i steer clear of nas, i don t buy into any reasoning except that they re trying to hide young whisky because of supplies    and it s not like they re heavily discounted versus aged versions, they still want the same amount of cash in many cases  i made an exception here because of my love for taketsuru and my dwindling (1/5th of my last bottle remaining) supply oh well    oh and to the comment about the price in japan   that s how it is with almost all japanese whisky    if you go to japan you will buy it for a fantastic price    but outside japan you pay the markup   it leads me to avoid most japanese whisky, it s good    but that international markup drives it outside of a respectable price point  i think my hibiki 18 was something like $40 when i was there last a couple years ago ",
926,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Uninspiring ,"on it s one with nothing to compare this is likely a good whiskey but over the course of a night of tasting this some out as status quo   uninspiring   albeit solid  not overpowering on the aroma, spicy but flat lines  one taster said  this is the white paint of whiskey  no depth to the flavour   another taster gets the  acid reflux  sensation which some might consider a long finish ",
927,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,"Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt (70cl, 43.0%)","en vã¤ldigt djup, mã¶rk och mastig doft av frukt samt lite lã¤tt sherry som ã¶vergã¥r till citron mot slutet  om jag inte visste hur mycket alkohol det var i denna sã¥ skulle jag gissat pã¥ cask strength pã¥ grund av de djupa dofterna  smaken ã¤r frã¤mst fruktig och maltig men man tycks hitta en gnutta havssalt samt sherry ocksã¥  man kã¤nner att den inte ã¤r lika stark som den tycks lukta, tyvã¤rr nã¥got spritig doften ã¤r sã¥ speciell att jag skulle vilja ge 5/5 genom att bara lukta pã¥ den men efter att ha smakat den ã¤r jag nã¥got besviken  hur som helst efter att ha haft ett par droppar vatten i den sã¥ ã¤r det en ganska god whisky i alla fall som fã¥r ett helhetsbetyg pã¥ 3,5/5 med tanke pã¥ det nã¥got fã¶r hã¶ga priset ",

930,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Brilliant,"i tried this at a whiskey bar in bethlehem, pa over the weekend  it was so spectacular that i bought a bottle immediately on the following monday  i am primarily a islay man - uigeadail  and lagavulin 16 are my mainstays  off the island i am a fan of glenmorangie - really enjoy the expressions [10, lasanta and quinta rubin] i have tried that said - i have never really found a blended malt that i truly enjoyed  until now  the taketsuru is in a class by itself when it comes to blends and it holds it own against almost all the single malts i have tried and i will say this - the tasting notes above are some of the most accurate i have seen  i can honestly say everything mention comes across the nose and the palate put this in regular rotation and you will not be disappointed ",
931,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Last Minute catch,"i just drove by the local nikka factory near sendai, japan  the factory closes at 4:30 pm and i got there at 4:26 pm  the taketsuru was on sale for about 3000 yen and i had to get the bottle quickly to the register and out of the shop  believe me, this was one of the best last minute deals i have ever landed  ",
932,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,A personal favourite,"i enjoy the range of scotches, from sweet and citrusy to pungent and peaty  that said, this relatively inexpensive,  delicate and  floral whisky is so far my favourite of them all, including quite a few at 3-4 times the cost (and not excluding some other japanese products)  i appreciate the subtlety, the complexity, the many layers and the long finish  a superb product  i can t recommend it enough  there are over 50 bottles in my scotch cabinet  this one is always at the very front  ",

949,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Now a believer!,i was one of the  japanese can t make great whisky guy   boy was i wrong  this thing is young and smooth but at the same time it has amazing complexity and a finale that seems to linger forever  now i crave it   simply amazing  now i have to get my hands on the miyagikyo  ,
950,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Impressed,i am a fan of hakushu whiskies & have been totally against non age statements  i bought this by mistake thinking it was a 12 year old nikka taketsuru as labeled on the shelf  i decided to give it a try since i have already bought it  i must say i am pleasantly surprised by how smooth & full bodied this tasted  it taste like a toned down hakushu 12  i am glad i have a few more bottles to enjoy  ,
951,Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt,Nikka,Can t be this one,"i am a bartender by trading, tried over 200 different scotches/ whiskies, this one blows them all away   very complete taste full body, smooth, and enjoyable to drink, just pick up a case of 6, will probably need to order more as they go fast, don t hold back on this one folks, enjoy the japanese styles",
952,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Brilliant,"uber smooth  a cross between a single malt and a bourbon  notes of chocolate, caramel, and espresso  seems like the issue with the nikka nas single malts that replaced the age statements is so many people loved the age statements and have not compared 10/12/15/20 yr olds to nas in blind tastings, seeing how many people like the coffey malt, coffey grain, and nikka from the barrel  ",
953,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,I always have one in my bar,a fantastic late evening whisky  one of my favourites ,
954,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,deludente,"male   molto male   deludente,dolciastro,ricorda il bourbon,molto ma molto caro per quello che vale",

959,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,I loved it,a friend brought some over for christmas dinner and i fell in love   it s a little sweet but not in a bad way   great smooth flavor,
960,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Not great,this stuff isn t horrible but it isn t what i would call great,
961,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Goes well with Helen Merrill with Clifford Brown,"it reminds you of some coffee liqueur you made your date lovelier, but it tastes far more refined  i usually go for islay single malt, but this one moved me into a different direction, or, destination  but the ultimate destination stays the same: helen merrill with clifford brown  a fabulous whiskey, a fabulous night of music  ",
962,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Wonderful,the biggest problem with this whisky is running out of it  fabulous stuff,
963,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Meh,not unpleasant but not particularly exciting  no stand out flavours  enyoyed the glass i tried would drink it again if it was going bit wouldn t pay for it  too much taste of raw alcohol aswel    meh,
964,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Very disapointed,"no complexity, no flavor, to much taste of alcool, nothing stay in mouth, very disapointed for the price it costs  i advise you a nikka black much much better, my favorit one",
965,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,One of the best nosing whiskies!,"a very well rounded whisky with notes of raisins, apricot, vanilla and toffee, yet without the lingering taste of honey   extremely smooth, with an oily viscous texture that coats the mouth   hard to come by in my region, but certainly worth the wait ",
966,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Wtf,"the smokeiness was okay, but the overall flavor was way off  barf   also, burping afterwards is the worse part ",
967,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Sweet with a lovely finish,"i tasted this tonight for the first time   the first taste was sweet, honey-like, but not at all cloying   notes of vanilla, toffee flavors   i sipped it neat and enjoyed it totally   it does not have the bite of a bourbon, rather a smooth finish more like a sweet scotch   i can drink this regularly with pleasure ",
968,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,"OK, not more","first of all - it is not single malt  it reminds me bourbon,as four roses (single barrel), but it is more subtle  sweet vanilla, corn as for me it is ok to drink with some meal (meat) not as digestive alex ",
969,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,A surprise in a bottle,i was drinking this strait for a bit when the flavor started to fall off  i started adding a cube of ice to cool it down and add some water and the flavor opened up and all the subtle flavors came out  i recommend this as an introduction to japanese whiskeys  i would definitely get this one again  ,
970,Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky,Nikka,Great Whiskey!,"really surprised by the taste- strong toffee flavor- smooth, slightly viscous   ",

980,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,Andy Just,"simple, bit smokey, bit dark chocolate, coffee, all mixed up in a wonderful taste  definitely top quality at this pricing level ",
981,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,i m a beginner and even i ......,"this is a wonderful whisky   fruit,peat spice, and hints of coffee and dark chocolate open up when swallowed  oily and coats your tongue  i feel like a vip when i drink this stuff, damn the japs, this is top quality  ",
982,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,"Nothing special, but...","i love this one  seems to be simple at the first sip to open up with every next  too complex or me (positively) to name all the tastes and smells i can feel (i blame the lack of proper tasting training)  in short: amazing for a blend  or rather the perfect example that blends can be great, too  8/10 for me  ",
983,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,yum,"delicious, interesting and smooth  there s interesting tastes of bertie basset based treat s, a little saline  well done nikka  ",

985,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,Mr Lewis,received a bottle as a gift a very nice surprise unknown to myself this whisky was thinner than the malts i usually drink but has  a wonderful flavour with a strong kick very much like penderyn whiskey ,
986,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,Disappointed,like someone has matured the spirit with sticking plasters  ,
987,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,stunning....,i am drinking this right now the nose is truly beautifulbags of glamouri just cannot stop sniffing itthe taste is immaculatetue obsession with japanese whiskey is in full flowevery whiskey i have purchased from japan is unique and carries bags of intelligence recommend this thoroughly    ,
988,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,Wow....Excellent,"if you like very well balanced with all obvious elements of smoke, peat, fruit, wood and sweet all working together perfectly then this is a beast   i could sniff this all day & sip this all night   it has an addictive nose (yes i do go to the cupboard and pull the cork sniff and put the cork back on many times with this one), beautiful taste and great long fade finish      i don t know what else can be asked for in a whisky?         well 70cl instead of 50cl maybe  ",
989,Nikka Pure Malt Black,Nikka,Great,"this really is a wonderfully balanced blend, well worth a purchase   fantastic flavours and a pleasure to drink ",
990,The Nikka 12 Year Old,Nikka,Simply amazing!,"full bodied, pleasant oak, rich, fruity (apple),  cream, vanilla and caramel with a touch of peat which gives it a salty/savory flavor   flavor profile is quite similar to highland park 12 but richer in flavor and taste  amazing for a blended whisky to be as rich and flavorful as a single malt scotch  easily blows away any blended scotch at 12 years old  its even way better than dewars 15 which is watery, spirity and lacks flavor and complexity  had this for less than 5000 yen and absolutely worth it for that price  too bad this whisky is overpriced outside of japan ",
991,The Nikka 12 Year Old,Nikka,A great blend,"itâ€™s a well rounded blend  smooth, tasty and very drinkable  would not buy again but once was definitely worth it  ",
992,The Nikka 12 Year Old,Nikka,Oh no! Not another great Japanese whisky!,"really  ? what are they up to? i don t drink blended whisky (occasional exception for the chivas regal 18 yr old)  oscar (great guy, runs my favourite liquor store, insists on sharing his  enthusiasm  even at 10 a m ) twisted my arm with a free sample  bought a bottle straight off  there s a big dash of yoichi in here so there is a nice, warming hint of peat  not so much peat that it blots out the delightful tropical fruit though  toasty, oaky, warm and creamy, butterscotch toffee and smooooooooooth  honestly, if you didn t know, you d never guess it was a blended whisky  this is a new permanent fixture in my collection ",
993,The Nikka 12 Year Old,Nikka,Advent calendar day 1,"big japanese whisky fan & this fits the mound  tinges of apple on the nose, but forgetting the pomp, this tastes amazing  great stuff, shall be getting a bottle ",
994,Nikka Coffey Gin,Nikka,This is an exceptional gin. It is something you have to try and something that will stun you once you do. It is unlike anything else. Goes very well with a slightly sweeter tonic and a wedge of lime or rapsberry.  DIVINE! ,"beautiful and floral, citrusy and woody, gentle yet serious 5/5",
995,Nikka Coffey Gin,Nikka,Exceptional,"this is an incredible gin  the smell   you can sip this with ice & nothing else  citrusy, a little different, simply divine",
996,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,Something to share with best friends. Amazing stuff and subtle.,"when i poured the first glass, the nose was like a typical highland whiskey, a bit of peat but also very strong  i have a lot of single malt  statement  first sips and i was sure i am drinking some of non-speyside highlander  the balance of this whiskey is one of the finest among blends, as usual, japanese have to bring everything to the new level  a bit pricey but i happily forgot about it after the first three sips  for some reason it has mixed reviews on various forums and websites  but i am giving it 5 stars, amazing blend ",
997,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,Better than you think ...,"i didn t expect much an grab it in the last minute in the warsaw duty free shop  i found out that its very good blended whisky  balance, elegant and full of flavours  ",
998,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,Exceptional value,"perhaps the best value in blended whiskies in the market now  so smooth, not too sweet, no alcohol whiff  haven t tasted a blended this nice since the old ballantine s 17 -- at half the price  ",
999,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,A treat,"try it with a little ice, it really opens up the flavour  beautiful whisky in every sense of the word ",
1000,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,my new ballantines 17,"perhaps the best value blend out there at the moment and a great replacement for the ballantines 17 which now offers poor value since the reduction to 40%  missing the subtle smoke of the ballantines, but makes up for it in other ways  deliciously sweet, clean and moreish, shows off nikka s complete command of blending  far better than suntory s entry level distillers reserve products, especially the overpriced hibiki harmony, and nearly as good as nikka s own coffey grain/malt for 2/3rds the price   ",
1001,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,I lied!,"i wrote the 3 star review right after opening, but i have to say, oxidization has really helped this whisky  tastes like the green label, but smells much better, like honey cake/custard ",
1002,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,Average,"very smooth on the palate, but seriously lacks depth  like the green label, but less depth, not as sweet, not as harsh (feels diluted)  nose is initially fairly boring, after a while begins to smell like custard ",
1003,Nikka Blended Whisky,Nikka,What a treat!,the flavour is so subtle  and after some time it smells like milk  ,

1010,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,"Smoky with a sweet finish, pairs good with a mild cigar","very good entry into japanese whisky  smooth, smoky with a sweet finish pairs good with a mild flavoured cigar, the smoky start and the smoke from the cigar cancel each other out and they bring all the notes from both to life ",

1016,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,A great entry point whisky,"if you re look for an entry into japanese whisky, this and  nikka blended whisky  are excellent value entry points that are affordable and worth every penny to the last drop  start your journey with these two and i m confident the palette will be appetising for more of what japan has to offer  they know their stuff, offer something unique, refined and a want for more ",

1024,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,Light but not without depth,"a lovely surprise  i m a recent convert to japanese single malts, and this blend is really quite special  smooth, light, but complex too - many tastes cross the palate - nuts, light fruit, wood, with a wonderful, almost lotus flower fragrance  tastes bring to mind a japanese tea garden after the rain  at this price too it s impossible not to buy, and try",
1025,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,Well Rounded Dram,a very well presented malt blend at a great price  just what effect the unique  coffey still  malt distillation process has is unclear but the end result is a very well-rounded dram with plenty of complexity and good flavour  i would love to taste it at 48% abv but you can t have everything    ,
1026,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,Too cheap,"this is an absolute bargain  it is a very well rounded sweet, smooth and tasty little number  very easy to drink and at this price it can easily be overlooked  dont hesitate to buy this  its just so easy to drink  very enjoyable,",
1027,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,Ooops... forgot my rating,"yep, again forgot to click the stars       review above ",
1028,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,The price is a joke.... The bottle might be awful.....,"but seriously - who buys whiskey and just looks at it?    at nearly â£20 cheaper than hibiki and yamazaki 12yo this is a serious, serious whiskey of all time contender  i very nearly didn t buy this because of the bottle and assuming it would be nowhere near as nice as the two other japanese whiskeys named above  the cellar man assured me this needed to be tried  a sample was had, then another just for good measure    and decision made    really really close to being as nice as the other japanese whiskeys  in my whiskey awards    approx  â£30 a bottle range  the winners are this green spot and balvenie  jason breen",
1029,Nikka All Malt,Nikka,Malt Mates  Delight,"has the usual bourbony sweetness with some banana    yeah   brown sugar and cinnamon on the nose  more luxurious and full than the abv would lead one to expect in the mouth the all malt cuts loose brown sugar, cactus nectar, cacao, barley of course, cashews, and last but not least, sherry cactus nectar, cask wood, dark chocolate, and maple tree sap (not syrup)   all told, this dram will float your boat   it s sea worthy ",

1034,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,"Anything you can do, we can do better........","i am really struggling to think of a scotch malt whisky that balances the sherried elements with the smoky as pleasingly as this does  admittedly 17 yrs is very old by japanese standards but even 30 year old islays that i ve tasted are either too heavy on phenol (bowmore, ardbeg, laphroig   ) or too light on smoke (bunnahabhain)  i ve had a few mildly smokey bunnas but to reach this level of complexity and smoothness, they have to be very old (39 yrs cadenheads single cask) and therefore very expensive  ditto the scappas and hps  bruichladdich pulled it off with the black arts 4 1, though that was very light on the smoke  older arrans can be very good but sherried expressions are very rare hats off to nikka therefore for a perfectly balanced (imo) rich, mildly smokey, slightly floral, honeyish, chocolatey malt  shame it s so darned expensive here in europe but i ll surely be stocking up on this one ",
1035,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,fantastic!,"omg, i can t believe how delicious this whisky is  the slight kick at the end was a surprise as i expected it to be smoother  but then again, it went so well that the little kick at the end just made it seem exotic  i need to stock up on this ",
1036,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Acetone,"my bottle had a face and mouth full of acetone  adding some water helped this, but then the fact that it was too long in the wood really shone through  the wisps of smoke were nice, though  but at best there is a consistency issue with this whisky ",

1041,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Terrific,very nice aroma with hint of oak wood  fantastic  ,
1042,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Fantastic,"got my bottle at narita airport last year for aprox 3500 yen which is a complete bargain for this one  everything with this whisky is very characteristic for nikka in general  hints of coffee, toffee, oak and the subtle pettiness would be a quick summary  this whisky is a mix of whiskies from their two distilleries miyagikyo and yoichi, which you understand if you have tried the single malts separately  miyagikyo is the more elegant and smooth one while yoichi is powerful and a bit peaty  the price defined at the website is a bit high in my opinion, but if you are in japan you can usually get it for under 6000 yen which is a great price for a whisky like this ",
1043,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Great if you can find it,"picked up a bottle when passing through narita a couple of weeks ago en route to the states from se asia  a mind-blowing 3500 yen (only â£19) for a taketsuru 17? i didn t even hesitate  my plan was to pack that one carefully in my checked bag and buy another bottle on the return trip a week and a half later, when i would be staying in tokyo for a few days  sadly, it had long since sold out throughout the airport by that time  with the help of some gracious locals, i was able to track down a small shop which had just gotten a fresh shipment in the previous day, and though they didn t carry the 17, they did have a few of the great taketsuru 21s in stock for only 6000 yen (â£32), so naturally, i snagged one of those as for the 17, well, it won wwa s world s best blended malt award in 2015, a very good sign, but of course whisky tasting is always going to be subjective  i personally like this one quite a lot    fragrant, spicy, warm, complex, a bit sharp on the finish, but that s easily moderated by toning down the alcohol with a splash of water  (even though this is a pretty standard 43% abv, the alcohol seems to stand out, particularly towards the end  i certainly don t think it overwhelms the dram, but it s slightly more pronounced than i might have expected ) this one doesn t have the subtle sweetness nor the sherry influence i picked up in the 21, so it s quite a different expression -- not sure if it s aged in the same casks, but my guess is not  this is a very nice bottle to have  though i do like this blend quite a lot, i don t think i d be keen to pay â£90 for it; however, for â£19, it was an easy choice  this is a great whisky, though when it comes to blended japanese 17s, i d have to give the hibiki 17 the nod over this one, though only just  i feel fortunate to have both in my collection ",
1044,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,"Complex Japanese Whisky, My Favorite To Date From Japan","tonight s whisky was the 17 year old nikka taketsuru  the nose was found behind the alcohol sitting as a nice winter pine for me  the taste gently wrapped the tongue in soft mint like notes before turning mildly peaty on the sides of my tongue  the ending allowed the soft entry to make way for a sharper finish with lingering peat like a fisherman s late october morning  more enjoyable japanese whisky than most i ve had because of the complexity - whereas the yamazaki 12 or coffy, or even the hokushu 25 were ultra clean and distinct in their even balance but lacking the rolling mysteries of flavor i personally like at this stage in my drinking experience   maybe my favorite japanese whisky to date ",
1045,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Nice to Sample,"sampled this as part of a tasting set  the palate is smooth, but there is a lot of alcohol on the nose and extra bite going into the finish  i was anticipating depth, but found this to be more one-note in my opinion  glad i sampled it, but it s just not to my liking - especially given the price  i have fond memories of japan that involve smoky bars, and similar whisky poured over perfectly carved spheres of ice  but sometimes it s the atmosphere that adds to the enjoyment of the experience    others could disagree with my statements, but with such varied reviews, i d recommend trying a sample first ",
1046,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Beautiful,"smooth and complex, one of my go to whiskeys ",
1047,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,Dissapointed,i ve had a bottle of the taketsuru 12 yr old and i was blown away by the quality for the price so i was very excited to buy the 17  sadly it was just wasn t up to snuff  way too much alcohol on show first of all  it hit really you the overall taste after was a little smoke and not much else  i was expecting much more ,
1048,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,damn near genius level dram,"lovely, absolutely lovely  anyone who doesn t enjoy this taketsuru 17 should have their head examined ",
1049,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,tim nice but dim,"overpriced at â£88 from paris cdg aiport duty free (funny how duty free costs more than royal mile at a more reasonable â£78) to qualify my  overpriced  statement, one can buy 15y/o springbank at around â£55, and that is very very good indeed          with this 17 y/o i could not detect even the slightest hint of smoke, absolutely zero  there is a slight prickle of peat on the tongue, only just  predominantly its sweet, minty, bourbon oak, malteser chocolates  exremely smooth, almost cloying so a single glass is more than enough   quite frankly i m bemused at the ratings because i will never buy another  ",
1050,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,"good, but the 21-year old is better","similar to the 15 year old yamazaki sherry cask, but more smooth perhaps closer to the glengoyne 17 year old still a bit of bite from the alcohol  not very spicy or warm, but tasty the 21-year old is a lot smoother and tastes 35% better in addition to being more smooth  i m a bit torn since i do like a little alcohol bite (not entirely smooth) with this type of whisky /joakim",
1051,Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old,Nikka,My first bottle in Tokyo,"i came back with three of these, 2 wrapped hopefully in the suitcase   but the first i bought was on a free day in tokyo   huge department store, and i wound my way down to where the bottles were sold   tasted a local saitama whiskey  quite good, but went with a small 180ml bottle of the whiskey that just won best blended in the world, nikka 17 year old wow  i now have an affection for the 180ml bottle   it allows for wonderful smelling   maybe a similar action to the whiskey glass (to be seen, those are in the mail to me now), but all i know is that this pure malt has a sweet deep nose   when smelling just right, one can smell it deep   it is cherry sweet all day long   yes this is a great whiskey in the mouth, but the nose defines it before you need to let it touch your lips this is high end  get it here   and tell everyone you know that duty free exiting japan had this for 3500 yen (domestically this sells for approx 5400;  whereas the hibiki 17 is 6500 duty free, 10500 domestically) no doubt, the hibiki is incredible  but from nikka i feel even more excited about japanese whiskey   the yoichi 10 (180ml also) i just opened in california is marvelous and very drinkable  (the 15 year yoichi must be unreal) but the nikka 17 might define a turning point in my life   i wanted something great that day and i found it   that s always a good thing of course, unlike the usa, it is legal to drink anywhere in japan   so i took a goofy sample cup, and relaxed and mozied around for a few hours in a beautiful, packed area, taking in the local feel, and pouring small amounts, smelling the wonderful port like sweetness and savoring the way a  great whiskey makes your mouth feel and taste ",

1068,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,Perfectly balanced of sweet and spice,"this is the best whisky i ve had to date  it s incredibly complex and well balanced, and just a real treat i m not sure what it was casked in, but it has a whiff of sherry about it to compliment, but then this nutty caramel sweetness that mellows into this warming  spice that just makes you smile  it s just great, and to me exactly what a whisky should be  i disagree with peaty being mentioned  for me, there s none of that  ",

1070,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,Outstanding Whisky ,"myself and a friend attended the yoichi distillery and, after tasting several including the 20 and 21 yr old, were disappointed to learn all the aged whisky was unavailable  happily, i have just obtained 2 bottles of the excellent 21 yr old  hint   it s a top blend and can still be found at very reasonable prices in  out of the way  japanese bottle shops   well worth searching for if you are in japan   ",
1071,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,Not discontinued ,"whilst there has been a restructuring of the nikka whisky lines, thankfully the taketsuru was not discontinued  it is the yoichi and miyakikyo age statement whiskies that have been discontinued  the retail price for the taketsuru in japan did recently go up however, and the 21 retails in department stores for approx jpy 15,000 (gbp 90)  the 17 for about half that  ",
1072,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,Now a collectors bottle.,"i was bought a bottle of this, just before they stopped producing it  i am afraid i will never get to taste it as if you can now find a bottle, it will cost you over 1000 euros        ",
1073,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,Best Scotch ever,"bought a bottle at narita airport - coming home from a long stay in korea and sagamihara japan  opened the bottle on a brisk fall evening while camping in late october, just me, my 8 year old white lab, a very nice camp fire, a fine cigar, and this 21 year old bottle of scotch  really - it does not get better than that  ",
1074,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,The End?,"according to nonjatta, nikka s whisky lineup will only be composed of nas bottlings-this means that from 2015 the 21 year old will be history    ",
1075,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,The pride of my collection,"when i saw this at narita airport for usd70, i thought they mislabelled it  i have about 20 bottles of whiskey at home, leaning towards the peaty  this bottle is my prized possession, which despite its price, i save only for the most special of occasions agree 100% with the guy with 30 bottles of whiskey  coats the tongue beautifully, and releases mild peat, lovely caramel flavours and a citrussy twist at the end to bring a smile to your face ",
1076,Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old,Nikka,A truly masterful blend,"i was fortunate enough to pick up both the 17yo and the 21yo on a trip to tokyo  even there, it s not easy to come by, but for whatever reason, the prices were astoundingly low -- though limited to the purchase of one bottle only  that s fine  the 17yo was 3500 yen (â£19), the 21yo was 6000 yen (â£32)  meanwhile, the yamazaki, hibiki, and hakushu were all fairly expensive -- presumably on account of the greater name recognition  for example, the yamazaki 25 was a staggering 250,000 yen (â£1350), and was sold out  even the 21 was 50,000 yen, and the hibiki 17 (which i very much like) was 20,000 yen, so the taketsuru 21 for just 6,000 was a no-brainer  i was able to get a sample and that sealed the deal, but really, for â£32, there wasn t much chance i wasn t going to buy this bottle  the shop had just gotten their stocks the previous day, i was told, after being sold out for over four months  like they say, timing is everything and not only was the taketsuru 21 an amazing value, it s really just a fantastic blend  it has a smooth, pleasant viscosity when sipped neat, but adding a bit of water really develops both the nose and the flavour  there s a sherry influence i quite like (i m a big fan of glenfarclas, so i m keen on sherry casks for whisky in general), and though it s hard to pinpoint what it is in the palate of the taketsuru, there is something distinctly asian about the whisky  it s just a lovely, lovely whisky, warm and spicy with just a hint of sweetness  it s super smooth, well-balanced, and pure pleasure to drink    truly one of my favourites, and i have close to 15 bottles of different japanese whiskies at home ",

1103,Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old,Nikka,Delicious,"my second bottle of japanese whisky; my understanding is that the distillery from which this specific blend of cask are chosen is located in hokkaido, the largest of the northern japanese islands  because of its latitude, hokkaido shares a similar climate to scotland, which the founder of nikka distilleries believed was essential to producing superior whiskeys  suntory brands, like the excellent hibiki, are distilled on honshu, which is the largest and most central of the japanese islands  the nikka 12 pure malt blend is much fruiter than hibiki 12, and has a sweeter, more round noise, with notes of vanilla and a caramelized sugars  the flavor is sweet and full, with notes of fruit and sherry, and a strong flavor of vanilla and marshmallows with delicate balance of peat which reminds me of the umami flavors in strong fermented soy sauces  however, both being japanese whiskeys, there are many flavor notes that are similar between the two; refreshing grassy notes and milk tea, with a surprising harmony between all the flavors    i would highly recommend this bottle as one of the growing number of excellent japanese whiskeys  ",
1104,Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old,Nikka,Excellent Contender,"i thought my favorite top five whiskeys were set in stone  but this has completely shaken up the list  the subtle peet taste, it s mild demeanor,  and light sweetness reminiscent of a fine bourbon come together in a novel way  furthermore it costs much less than many of my other favorites whiskeys",
